    <h2>Music: an Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Noh relies greatly on musical expression. Its structure, emotive tone and narrative flow are carried in great part by the singing of actors and the accompaniment of an instrumental ensemble. Music is present throughout. It begins with highly evocative tuning (<em>oshirabe</em>) and continues through intoned recitations, chant and instrumental numbers. One does not hear music only during certain entrances or exits of actors or for moving of stage properties. </p>

    <h3 id="Performers">Performers</h3>
    <p>The <a href="/music/voices" target="_blank">vocal music</a> in the form of Noh chant (<em>utai</em>) plays a central role and is performed by a principal actor (<em>shite</em>), a supporting actor (<em>waki</em>), a kyōgen actor (<em>ai</em>) and chorus (<em>jiutai</em>). The instrumental ensemble and its music (<em>hayashi</em>) serve to accompany singing, dances, and entrances and exits of actors. It is comprised of one pitched instrument: the <a href="/music/nohkan" target="_blank">nohkan</a> (noh flute), and two unpitched percussion instruments: the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi">ōtsuzumi</a> (hip drum) and <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi">kotsuzumi</a> (shoulder drum). About half of the plays in current repertoire include a third drum, the <a href="/music/taiko" target="_blank">taiko</a> (stick drum).  With a few rare exceptions taiko only joins in for the second half of a play. Between percussion strokes the drummers perform highly expressive vocal calls (<em>kakegoe</em>) that provide an original vocal dimension even in the accompanying parts.</p>

    <h3 id="Rhythm">Rhythmic Organization</h3>
    <p>The rhythmic organization in Noh is highly sophisticated, complex and carries immense dramatic potential. Its basic unit of time is an 8-beat measure (<em>honji</em>), which is used for all instrumental music, such as dance, entrance and exit music. It is also the basic unit of time for vocal music but in this case, it is possible to sporadically encounter measures of 2, 4, or 6 beats, used to accommodate the syllabic structure of the text. Despite this mostly fixed underlying structure, the immense flexibility of the individual beats and multiple ways of synchronization between instruments result in great rhythmic variety and expressive richness.</p>

        <p>Flexibility of pulse is the norm in Noh. The duration of each beat can be negotiated intuitively between expressive needs of all performers, one beat at time. Some beats of the eight-beat unit are extended or shrunk, predictably according to performance traditions. For instance, it is customary for the eighth beat to be extended and for beats 1, 3 and 5 to be shrunk. When the beats are shrunk the odd beat is not followed by a kakegoe. Regular pulse is almost exclusively found in dance, noriji, and some entrance music.</p>

        <p>The notion of strict synchronization between all players is also an exception rather than the norm. For instance, the first beat of the eight-beat unit, which for Western ensembles would traditionally serve as an accent and a point of rhythmic unity, in Noh is often silent. It is "performed" internally in the mind of the musicians a process referred to as <em>komi</em>. In the video showcasing strict and flexible rhythmic settings, the second, fourth and sixth beats are most of the time performed as <em>komi</em> as well. The sound that follows is timed according to an individual musician's sense of pacing. The notion of “togetherness” is not based on exact coincidence of the attack but on a cohesion of overall flow, energy, and expression. In the same spirit, most of the time the nohkan’s part is metrically independent from the percussion part and there are many instances when that is the case for the chant as well.</p>

        <p>There are two types of rhythmic correlation between the voice, flute and percussion instruments. The correlation is 'congruent' when the nohkan and/or vocal parts align with the eight-beat unit(<em>honji</em>), whereas it is said to be 'non-congruent' when they do not. The former provides rhythmic stability, the latter rhythmic flexibility.</p>

        <p>In the non-congruent rhythmic setting, the degree of independence vis-à-vis the eight-beat unit varies according to the instruments:  A non-congruent vocal line is totally independent from the eight-beat unit, in the sense that it does not start or end on a specific beat, and at no time is it expected to align with a specific beat.  A non-congruent nohkan part begins and ends at some specific points often related to the text, but the music between these two points in not synchronized within the 8 beat measure. </p>

    <p> There is no conductor in noh. Most of the time chant or dance of the actors initiate and lead the musical flow for all other performers. Jiutai and hayashi are next and considered equal to each other. Within <em>hayashi</em> the hierarchy continues from stage right to the left. Taiko leads, if present, followed by ōtsuzumi, kotsuzumi, and finally, the nohkan. This relationships can occasionally be adjusted when one of the lower ranked instruments is being performed by someone of greater experience. At certain structural moments it is also common that the actors wait for instrumentalist to start or finish their parts. </p>
<h3 id="Pitch">Pitch Organization</h3>
    <p>The melodic language of Noh is not dependent on absolute pitches. With the nohkan being the only pitched instrument there is no need for the hayashi to tune to each other. There is no expected pitch coordination between nohkan and utai either although at times they share a general range that outlines a larger common structure.  </p>
    <p>
    The loudness of instruments is relatively constant. The lower register of the flute is naturally softer and is used according to dramatic or formal function.  The kakegoe as well as chant can match in loudness the dramatic character of the scene or role.  </p>

    <h3 id="Form">Form</h3>
    <p>
    The music in Noh draws on a common collection of rhythmic and melodic patterns. Many of the same patterns occur multiple times within a single play and in different sections of a play leading to a great unity and self-similarity. But this seeming limitation is well balanced by the abundance of variants and tempi, a flexibility with which the patterns are sequenced into larger phrases, and by original expressive inflection of specific plays and particular performances. Patterns form larger structural modules <a href="/catalog-of-shodan" target="_blank">(<em>shōdan</em>)</a> that reoccur throughout the repertoire and which are grouped into sections according to function within each of the two acts of a play.  </p>

    <h3 id="Transmission">Transmission</h3>
    <p>
    The vocal styles, instruments with their performance techniques, as well as melodic and rhythmic language are unique to Noh and mastering them requires many years of specialized training. Noh is taught through oral transmission. Each role and instrument has its own tradition preserved and taught within hereditary schools named after their founders. There are five shite, three waki, two ai-kyōgen, five ōtsuzumi, four kotsuzumi, two taiko, and three nohkan schools. Most of them publish or hand-copy summary notation of their school’s individual parts but these are meant only as learning aids as all performances are done from memory.</p>

    <h3 id="Notation">Notation</h3>
    <p>A clarification must be made about the music notation used on this website. Conversely to Western tradition there are no complete study scores for any given play. Each of the twenty-four schools has their own individual scores and variants of notation (there are five shite, three waki, two ai-kyōgen, five ōtsuzumi, four kotsuzumi, two taiko, and three nohkan schools). In the performance of a Noh play, it is the school of the shite that becomes the reference and it is the responsibility of the waki and ai-kyōgen actors and musicians to adapt their parts to the shite’s. Scores for individual instruments are written on a grid of eight blocks and they are read from top to bottom and from right to left. </p>

    <p>On this website, all scores combining more than one instrument are our own transcriptions. We retained the characteristic note-heads of various percussion instruments’ strokes but set them on horizontal lines. Occasionally, due to limited space we have provided summarized scores, merging the ōtsuzumi’s and kotsuzumi’s patterns into a single line.</p>

    <p>For example, the following rhythmic patterns:</p>
    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-1-Complete.png" %}
    <p>have been notated as:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-1-Condensed.png" %}


     <p>And these patterns:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-2-Complete.png" %}
     <p>have been notated as:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-2-Condensed.png" %}

     <p>where the left strokes on the first, third and sixth beats corresponds to the ōtsuzumi’s stroke, the right ones to the kotsuzumi’s. We have followed the same sequencing when merging <em>kakegoe</em> and stroke, thus the <em>'yo''</em> on the second half of the fourth beat is called by the ōtsuzumi player at the same time as the kotsuzumi player performs a <em>pu</em> stroke.</p>

     <p>Finally, when the taiko is playing with the other two hand-drums, only its part has been notated.</p>
