  <p>The monk opens the <em>shōdan</em> by reciting the first line in <a href="/music/voices#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a>. We surmise that he is in the process of dedicating flowers to Buddha, when he expresses surprise, noticing a smiling white flower among his lot. As he wonders about its provenance, he casually turns toward the apparition as if hoping for an answer. Her reply in singing mode creates an aura of mystery and beauty. Is she indeed answering him or is her reply to be understood as emanating out of thin air? As she sings, she continues to slowly come closer to the monk but without facing him. After arriving at <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a>, she further delays coming in visual contact with him by first facing the audience. Only later does she turn toward the monk and identifies the white flower as the ‘evening face’(yūgao in Japanese). As if enchanted, it is in <time datetime='00:16:34.000' title='00:16:34'> singing mode </time> that the monk asks the woman to identify herself. Now facing front to engage the audience as much as the monk, she replies in <time datetime='00:16:57.000' title='00:16:57'>spoken mode</time>, that she is not ready to reveal her identity. The change in the mode of delivery from singing to speaking puts an emphasis on the retreat quality of her reply. Yet, turning once again to face the monk she offers a clue, stating that she comes from the white flower’s shadow.</p>

  <p>There is a double entendre in the reply. Prince Genji who was on his way to visit one of his mistresses could not help but stop when he noticed a beautiful white flower on a fence in front of a dilapidated house. As he was admiring the flower, he noticed a beautiful woman in the house. It is as the ‘shadow’ of the white flower that Prince Genji met the lady who became known as Lady Yūgao, named after the flower. Her real name is never mentioned in the novel. Thus, it is in the same fashion that Hashitomi’s main character has been introduced to the monk.</p>

  <p>In comparison to most plays, the shite's self-introduction happens rather early in this play. Still, the text remains ambiguous enough to maintain the spirit of mystery characteristic of almost all Noh plays.</p>
