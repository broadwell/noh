      The scene is shaped by the combination of story-telling, stage movement and changing modes of singing.
      </p><p>
      The priest speaks first in kotoba mode. We surmise that he is in the process of dedicating flowers to Buddha, when he expresses surprise, noticing for the first time a smiling white flower among the lot. He <time datetime='00:14:02.000' title='00:14:02'>turns to the shite and asks</time> her about it. The shite’s reply in singing mode adds to the aura of mystery and beauty and sets apart her statement. As she sings she continues to approach the priest very gradually but without providing answers and her identity remains elusive. Even after arriving at Square 1 she first faces the audience and only later turns toward the priest and <time datetime='00:16:11.000' title='00:16:11'>identifies the white flower as the ‘evening face’ </time>(<em>iugao</em> in Japanese). This manner of shite turning toward the waki while introducing themselves is a standard movement in Noh. At this point the waki in singing mode  <time datetime='00:16:34.000' title='00:16:34'>asks the shite to identify herself </time>.  Now facing front to engage the audience as much as the waki, <time datetime='00:16:58.000' title='00:16:58'>she replies in a spoken mode</time>. This change in the mode of delivery puts an emphasis on the text as we find out that she is not ready to reveal her name. Turning once again to face the priest <time datetime='00:17:12.000' title='00:17:12'>she drops a clue </time>, stating that she comes from the white flower’s shadow.
      </p><p>
      There is in fact a beautiful double entendre in her reply. Prince Genji who was on his way to visit one of his mistresses could not help but stop when he noticed a beautiful white flower on a fence in front of a dilapidated house. As he was admiring the flower, he noticed a beautiful woman in the house. It is as the ‘shadow’ of the white flower that the protagonist of Hashitomi met Prince Genji, the same way as she has just been introduced to the priest. She became known as Lady Yūgao, named after the flower. Her real name is never mentioned in the novel.
      </p><p>
      In comparison to most plays this self-introduction by the shite happens very early after their arrival on stage but the ambiguity of the text keeps with the spirit of mystery, which is expected to be maintained and is at the heart of almost all Noh plays.
