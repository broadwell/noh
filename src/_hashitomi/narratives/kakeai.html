      The scene is shaped by the combination of story-telling, stage movement and changing modes of text delivery .
      </p><p>
      The priest opens the <em>shōdan</em> delivering his line in <a href="/music/voices/#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a>. We surmise that he is in the process of dedicating flowers to Buddha, when he expresses surprise, noticing for the first time a smiling white flower among his lot. He <time datetime='00:14:33.000' title='00:14:33'>turns toward the woman </time> and asks her about it.<br>
      Her reply in singing mode adds an aura of mystery and beauty to her statement. As she sings she continues to slowly come closer to the priest. In fact, after arriving at <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a> she further delays coming in visual contact with him, by first facing the audience and only later does she turn toward the priest and identifies the white flower as<time datetime='00:16:11.000' title='00:16:11'> the ‘evening face’ </time> (<em>iugao</em> in Japanese).<br>
      At this point, it is in singing mode that the priest asks the woman <time datetime='00:16:46.000' title='00:16:46'> to identify herself </time>.  Now facing front to engage the audience as much as the priest, she replies <time datetime='00:16:57.000' title='00:16:57'> in a spoken mode</time>, that she is not ready to reveal her identity.The change in the mode of delivery from singing to speaking puts an emphasis on her text, and stresses the fact that she is not yet ready to state her name. Yet, turning once again to face the priest <time datetime='00:17:12.000' title='00:17:12'>she drops a clue </time>, stating that she comes from the white flower’s shadow.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is in fact a beautiful double entendre in her reply. Prince Genji who was on his way to visit one of his mistresses could not help but stop when he noticed a beautiful white flower on a fence in front of a dilapidated house. As he was admiring the flower, he noticed a beautiful woman in the house. It is as the ‘shadow’ of the white flower that the protagonist of Hashitomi met Prince Genji, the same way as she has just been introduced to the priest. She became known as Lady Yūgao, named after the flower. Her real name is never mentioned in the novel.
      </p><p>
      In comparison to most plays, the shite's self-introduction happens rather early in this play. Still, the text remains ambiguious enouhg to maintain the spirit of mystery, a characteristic which is at the heart of almost all Noh plays.
