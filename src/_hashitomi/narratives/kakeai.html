  <p>The overall expression of the <em>shōdan</em> stays rather simple but there is a subtle increase in the Intermedia Index. It results from the combination of: using more of the stage, a direct interaction between actors and by changing the mode of text delivery from <em>kotoba</em> to chanting. </p>

  <p>The monk opens the <em>shōdan</em> by reciting the first line in <em>kotoba</em>. We surmise that he is in the process of dedicating flowers to Buddha, when he expresses surprise, noticing a smiling white flower among his lot. As he wonders about its provenance, he turns towards the apparition as if hoping for an answer. Her reply in singing mode creates an aura of mystery and beauty. Is she indeed answering him? or is this scene rather part of his imagination? As she sings, she continues to slowly come closer to the monk but without facing him. After arriving at Square 1, she further delays coming in visual contact with him by first facing the audience. Only later does she turn toward the monk and identifies the white flower as the ‘evening face’(<em>iugao</em> in Japanese). As if enchanted, it is in <time datetime='00:16:34.000' title='00:16:34'> singing mode </time> that the monk asks the woman to identify herself. Now facing front to engage the audience and the monk, she replies in <time datetime='00:16:57.000' title='00:16:57'>spoken mode</time>, that she is not ready to reveal her identity. The change back to speaking, suggests her position on the topic is firm. Yet, turning once again to face the monk she offers a clue, stating that she comes from the white flower’s shadow.</p>

  <p>There is a double entendre in the reply. In Murasaki Shikibu's novel <em>Genji monogatari</em>, Prince Genji who was on his way to visit one of his mistresses could not help but stop when he noticed beautiful white flowers on a fence in front of a dilapidated house. As he was admiring them, he noticed a beautiful woman in the house. Thus, it is as the ‘shadow’ of the white flower that Prince Genji met the lady who became known as Lady Yūgao, named after the flower. Her real name is never mentioned in the novel. Thus, it is in the same fashion that Hashitomi’s main character has been introduced to the monk.</p>
