    <p>
      The expression of the module remains simple. The subtle and gradual increase in richness of the intermedia texture is shaped by the combination of raising energy of used stage positions, more direct interaction between actors and changing modes of text delivery from <em>kotoba</em> to chant.
      </p><p>
      The monk opens the <em>shōdan</em> by reciting the first line in <a href="/music/voices/#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a>. We surmise that he is in the process of dedicating flowers to Buddha, when he expresses surprise, noticing a smiling white flower among his lot. He <time datetime='00:14:33.000' title='00:14:33'>turns toward the woman apparition</time> and asks her about it.
      Her reply in singing mode creates an aura of mystery and beauty. As she sings, she continues to slowly come closer to the monk but without facing him. After arriving at <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a> she further delays coming in visual contact with the monk, by first facing the audience. Only later, does she turn toward the monk and identifies the white flower as<time datetime='00:16:11.000' title='00:16:11'> the ‘evening face’ </time> (<em>yūgao</em> in Japanese).
      As if enchanted, it is in singing mode that the monk asks the woman <time datetime='00:16:46.000' title='00:16:46'> to identify herself</time>.  Now facing front to engage the audience as much as the monk, she replies <time datetime='00:16:57.000' title='00:16:57'> in a spoken mode</time>, that she is not ready to reveal her identity. The change in the mode of delivery from singing to speaking puts an emphasis on the retreat quality of the reply. Yet, turning once again to face the monk <time datetime='00:17:12.000' title='00:17:12'>she offers a clue</time>, stating that she comes from the white flower’s shadow.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is a double entendre in the reply. Prince Genji who was on his way to visit one of his mistresses could not help but stop when he noticed a beautiful white flower on a fence in front of a dilapidated house. As he was admiring the flower, he noticed a beautiful woman in the house. It is as the ‘shadow’ of the white flower that the protagonist of Hashitomi met Prince Genji, the same way as she has just been introduced to the monk. She became known as Lady Yūgao, named after the flower. Her real name is never mentioned in the novel.
      </p><p>
      In comparison to most plays, the shite's self-introduction happens rather early in this play. Still, the text remains ambiguious enough to maintain the spirit of mystery characteristic of almost all Noh plays.
