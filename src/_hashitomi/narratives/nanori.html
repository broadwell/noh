    <p>The level of intermedia energy remains very low. The monk's introduction and explanation of intentions are done in the simplest way. There is no musical accompaniment, the speech using a more common sanbun language is calm and steady and there is practically no movement while he remains in a very calm position on Square 1. The very simple intermedia expression of the first vocal shōdan is typical for the first section of a Noh.</p><p>The monk concludes the section by bringing his hands together, holding a Buddhist <time datetime='00:06:28.303' title='00:12:98.987'>rosary</time>   in the right hand. While the origin of the gesture is believed to be related to prayer, it has become a standard closing gesture also used by secular characters such as the <a href="/kokaji/nanori/#startTime=00:04:49" target="_blank"> Emperor’s envoy </a> in Kokaji. </p>
