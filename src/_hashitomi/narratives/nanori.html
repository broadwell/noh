  <p>The spoken unaccompanied monk's introduction and explanation of intentions are done in the simplest way. The speech is tranquil and steady, and there is practically no movement, as he remains on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a>  for the delivery of his speech. Although the overall texture remains simple, the narrative has answered the who, why, what and where questions about the waki, and that is why this <em>shōdan</em> has a higher Intermedia Index than the preceding <em>nanoribue</em>. Although the modest monk remains name-less, we now know that he is from the Urin-in shrine in Murasakino, and that he is about to perform a memorial service to honor the flowers he offered throughout the summer.</p>

  <p>The monk concludes the <em>nanori</em>  by bringing his hands together, holding a Buddhist rosary in the right hand. While the origin of the gesture is believed to be related to prayer, it has become a standard closing gesture also used by secular characters such as the <a href="/kokaji/nanori/#startTime=00:04:49" target="_blank"> Emperor’s envoy </a> in Kokaji.</p>
