  <p>The Shite Performs section consisting of <em>kuse</em> and the following <em>jonomai</em> dance, together with the final <em>kiri</em> are the high points of intermedia richness and dramatic energy of the whole play. The three shōdan are also typically the longest within the play. Most of the performers are active, music is to a large extent congruent, the movement adds significant mimetic dimension and most of the stage is used. </p>
  <p> The <em>kuse</em> has three particular points of intermedia interest. The first one is concerned with how mimicking <em>kata</em> are used to provide the text with visual representation. The second looks at the fluid identity of shite and jiutai as the text and movement keep redefining their roles. The third point considers how various musical techniques are used to emphasize phrases in the text. This includes the use of range, rhythmic patterns, and irregular measures.</p>

  <section id='part1' title='Part I' class='tabbed-narrative'>

    <div class="section-introduction__term">Intermedia Part-I</div>
      <p>
        The flower ritual that the monk is performing brings back memories to Lady Yūgao about the prayer to Buddha that she and Genji heard the very first night they spent together.
        Part I is divided into two sub-parts: The first one provides context as the jiutai is narrating the story, whereas in the second sub-part refers to Lady Yūgao’s emotions.</p>

        <p>The text of the first sub-part introduces Genji and his short romance with Lady Yūgao. As it is common for a <em>kuse,</em> the melody starts in the low range when a <time datetime='00:52:31.000' title='00:52:31'> Left Stamp</time> on the seventh beat of the third <em>honji</em>  triggers a short and sudden incursion in the high range over the words “Tada karibushi no yo mo sugara/Through the night they heard from next door a pilgrim’s voice in prayer”, thereby emphasizing the importance of the heard prayer. Then, a Right Stamp on the seventh beat of the following <em>honji</em>  triggers a return to the medium and subsequently low range.</p>

        <p>At this point, the text refers to the “pilgrim’s voice in prayer”, hence the shite makes a <time datetime='00:53:02.000' title='00:53:02'>Right Step pivot</time> and takes Three Steps Forward and one Step Backward as to better position herself to listen to the prayer. She then performs a ‘Mind listening’ <em>kata</em> by bending her upper body forward.</p>

        <p>As the jiutai is about to recite the <em>sutra</em> “Namutōraidōshi Mirokub’to zo tonaekeru”, the kotsuzumi player plays his <em><time datetime='00:53:34.000' title='00:53:34'>hajiki</time></em> pattern which include an off-beat attack that immediately follows the ōtsuzumi’s stroke on the first beat. This rarely used pattern with its oddly positioned attack creates a syncopated bouncing effect that calls for the listener's attention, preparing the mood for the coming prayer. The <em>sutra</em> includes 21 syllables, set in a sequence of four measures: <em>toriji</em> (4-beat measure), <em>kataji</em> (6-beat measure), <em>toriji</em> (4-beat measure), and a <em>honji</em> (8-beat measure), for a total of 22 beats or 44 syllable-slots. As an outcome of this larger than needed number of beats, the delivery speed of the text <time datetime='00:53:39.000' title='00:53:39'>  slows down </time> resulting in an appropriate pacing for the recitation of a prayer.</p>

  <section id="part2" title="Part II" class="tabbed-narrative">
    <div class="section-introduction__term">Intermedia Part-II</div>
      <p>
      As it is standard in dances, the Opening Fan <em>kata</em> marks the beginning of the dance’s next section, in this case Part-II. The expanding use of the space is also indicative of the beginning of a new section. Indeed, while the performance of <em>kata</em> in Part-I was located around <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares"target="_blank">Square 9</a>, it expands to Squares 2 and 3 in Part II.
      </p>

      <p>In the first sentence of Part II, Lady Yūgao tells the monk about her first encounter with Genji, hence it positioned her in the present. Lady Yūgao reminisces about three specific moments, each one shares the same melodic shape and the same transformation in its mode of delivery. More specifically, each of the three melodic lines start in the medium range and cadence in the low, and each one starts in the declamatory <a href="/music/voices/#Mitsuji-utai" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a> accompanied by sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji"target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns before switching to  <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-utai" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a> accompanied by steady <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke"target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke</em></a> patterns.</p>

      <p>Lady Yūgao’s first memory refers to the moment Genji <time datetime='00:56:01.000' title='00:56:01'>first saw her house</time>. The second one refers to Genji beckoning his foster brother Koremitsu to pick up the ‘evening face’ flower for him. By performing the Beckoning Fan <em>kata</em> at the same instant as she recalls the moment, <time datetime='00:56:30.000' title='00:56:30'>the shite becomes Genji</time>. Then, the jiutai speaking Genji’s words orders his foster brother to pick up the white flower. By extending the fan and turning to face the <em>tsukurimono</em>, the shite is still Genji who <time datetime='00:56:40.000' title='00:56:40'>identifies the flower</time> his foster brother is to pluck.</p>

      <p>Finally, the last and third memory refers to the <time datetime='00:56:54.000' title='00:56:54'>white fan</time> that foreshadows Genji and Lady Yūgao’s encounter. According to the <em>Genji Monogatari</em>, a young servant girl stepped out of the house and provided a guard rather than Koremitsu with a scented white fan and told him, as he was about to pluck the flowers, “Here give them to him on this – their stems are so hopeless”. Although no narrated, this moment of the story is summarized with the shite turning to face front and performing the Offering the Fan <em>kata</em>, hence for that short gesture, the shite is the young servant. Then, the jiutai tells that the flower was picked and presented. Hence, the shite becomes Koremitsu as he performs a sequence of mimicking <em>kata</em>: <time datetime='00:57:15.000' title='00:57:15'>Left Hand pick up of the flower, Laying of the flower on the fan, Kneeling and the Two Hands Offering of the Fan</time>.</p>

  <section id="part3" title="Part III" class="tabbed-narrative">
    <div class="section-introduction__term">Intermedia Part-III</div>

      <p>At the beginning of Part III the shite becomes Genji in a moving moment. This is the sole time in the <em>kuse</em> when shite sings (<em>ageha</em>). In Kneeling Position he is looking at his fan <time datetime='00:57:46.000' title='00:57:46'>and chants: “Genji, gazing at it intently”</time>. </p>
      <p>
      Jiutai then speaks for Lady Yūgao, when it tells that it is while contemplating a flower at her gate that Genji noticed her in the distance, and that their love bloomed out of a flower presented on a fan. From that moment, the jiutai starts speaking for Genji and alludes to the poem he wrote on the fan, but the narration is interrupted by the elegant dance: <em>jonomai</em>. Hence, one has to wait until the next <em> shōdan </em>, the <em> waka</em> to hear Genji’s love poem.
      </p>
      <p>The jiutai’s reply coincides with the entrance of the <time datetime='00:58:09.000' title='00:58:09'>nohkan’s</time> pattern <a href="/music/nohkan/takanemikusari" target="_blank"><em>takane mi kusari</em></a>. It starts with a five-syllable line stretched over the <em>honji’s</em> eight beats, thereby emphasizing its text “Of you passing in the distance…”. The shite who performs at the same time a Large Zigzag, as if passing in the distance, <time datetime='00:58:10.000' title='00:58:10'>becomes Lady Yūgao</time>. The <em>kata</em> takes her from Square 2 to the dynamic Square 4 where she concludes with a <time datetime='00:58:45.000' title='00:58:45'>Scooping Point</time> followed by an Open-retreat, thereby opening Part III by further expanding the use of the stage-space.</p><p>
      The melodies corresponding to the text “Of you passing in the distance…” and  “… and if I had not answered about the flower” are both set in the declamatory <em>mitsuji-utai</em>, which has the effect of increasing momentum and adding a dramatic stress to the words. The following line of twelve syllables delivered in <em>tsuzuke-utai</em> is set over a <em>honji</em> preceded by a <em>toriji</em> (four-beat measure), hence creating a slowdown in the declamation that emphasizes the dramatic words: <time datetime='00:58:46.000' title='00:58:46'>“forever we must have remained strangers.”</time>.</p>

      <p>The dance is also gaining in momentum. The <em>kata</em> Take the Corner brings the main character to a strong position on Square 3. This is where over the words: "by the fan touched by our hands" the shite mimics the text with a <time datetime='00:59:08.000' title='00:59:08'> Fan to the Left hand </time> <em>kata</em>. After a Large Left Circle (Squares 3 – 9 - 1), the sequence ends on Square 1. </p>

      <p> An interesting identity switch takes place at this point as the jiutai starts singing Genji's words. Thus, once on Square 1, and over the lines “…in a joyous pledge of love…”, the shite performs a <time datetime='00:59:51.000' title='00:59:51'> Feather Fan</time> <em>kata</em>, as he takes Nine Steps towards the waki. By offering him the fan, he becomes Genji, while the waki for this brief moment stands for Lady Yūgao. </p>

      <p> Finally, the shite initiates the closing sequence that will take him center stage after having traversed the front stage lateral. The sequence starts with a <time datetime='01:00:04.000' title='01:00:04'> Renesting the Fan,</time> followed with a dynamic Take the Corner with Extended Fan, and a Large Circle (3-5-9) that takes him to Square 9, in front of the <em>tsukurimono</em>, where he performs a <time datetime='01:01:02.000' title='01:01:02'> Small Zigzag followed by a Closure scoop </time>, a standard sequence of <em>kata</em> used for closing a section. </p>
