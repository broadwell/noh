  <p>There are usually two dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em> in a play: the <em>kuse</em> and the <em>kiri</em>. Intermedia relationships are typically at their height in these <em>shōdan</em> as their text is correlated with mimetic movements, with dramatic use of stage-space and with appropriate accompanying music.</p>

  <p>When the spirit of Lady Yūgao (sung by jiutai) recounts that during her first night with Genji the lovers heard from next door a pilgrim’s voice in prayer, the shite performs a slow sequence of <time datetime='00:53:09.000' title='00:53:09'>steps that leads to the subtle Mind Listening <em>kata</em></time>, done by slighly bending the upper body forward. As the jiutai is about to recite the <em>sutra</em> the kotsuzumi plays a <em><time datetime='00:53:34.000' title='00:53:34'>hajiki</time></em> pattern which includes an off-beat attack that immediately follows the ōtsuzumi’s stroke on the first beat. This rarely-used pattern with its oddly-positioned attack creates a syncopated effect that creates a sort of "quotation mark" before the prayer begins. <time datetime='00:53:39.000' title='00:53:39'> The <em>sutra</em></time> includes 21 syllables, set in a sequence of four uneven measures (4, 6, 4 and 8 beats long). This allows for a spacious distribution of syllables and slow pacing appropriate for a prayer.</p>

  <p>Moved by the monk's service for the flowers, Lady Yūgao shows him a <time datetime='00:54:30.000' title='00:54:30'>profound appreciation</time> by taking Five Steps in his direction, then One Step Back, before performing the <a href="/ movement/kneeling-p/" target="_blank">Kneeling in Prayer</a>. As the jiutai sings: “<em>… unwittingly tears dampen my sleeves</em>” the shite performs  <a href="/movement/l-hand/" target="_blank">Left-Hand Weeping</a> <em>kata</em>.  This poignant moment ends with the two percussion instruments playing the standard closing <em><time datetime='00:55:29.000' title='00:55:29'>uchikiri</time></em> pattern. </p>

  <p>Mimesis can take a different form when abstract structural <em>kata</em> are given meaning by the text. For instance, when the jiutai sings <time datetime='00:55:59.000' title='00:55:59'>“<em>When Genji first saw this house</em>”</time>, the shite performs a standard Forward pointing <em>kata</em> but because it is directed towards the <em>tsukurimono</em> it implies Prince Genji's pointing to Lady Yūgao's house.</p>

  <p>A moment later, we hear that  <time datetime='00:56:54.000' title='00:56:54'>Genji beckons his personal attendant Koremitsu</time> to pick a flower for him that grows over the house. The shite, now personifies Koremitsu who carries out the order. It appears as a mimetic <em>kata</em> sequence: Left hand pick up of the flower, Laying of the flower on the fan, Kneeling and the Two hands offering of the fan. The moment of offering the flower on the fan is given dramatic emphasis by a significant slow-down of the music, addition of an extra measure of just 4 beats and the <em>ageha</em>, the short and sole vocal entrance of the shite during the whole <em>kuse</em></p>

  <p> The text of the <time datetime='00:57:37.000' title='00:57:37'><em>ageha</em></time> refers to the flower on the fan, as the shite sings “<em>Genji, gazing at it intently</em>”. The shite, by looking intently at his fan personifies Genji. Finally, as the jiutai sings words attributable to Genji “<em>Of you passing in the distance...</em>” the shite performs a <a href="/movement/large-zigzag/" target="_blank">Large Zigzag</a> interpretable as the walk of Lady Yūgao.  The intensity of the moment when Genji first saw Lady Yūgao, is underlined by the entrance of the nohkan’s <a href="/music/nohkan/takanemikusari" target="_blank"><em>takane mi kusari</em></a> pattern.</p>

  <p>The text divides the narrative into three parts, each one marked by gradual increase in the use of stage-space. The <time datetime='00:51:58.000' title='00:51:58'>first part</time> introduces Genji and his romance with Lady Yūgao, as she recalls the prayer that they heard on their first night. The introductory quality of the narrative is reflected in limiting the stage-space to the center-stage (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 9</a>). The tone of the <time datetime='00:55:46.000' title='00:55:46'>second part</time> intensifies slightly as the spirit of Lady Yūgao remembers that her introduction to Genji was initiated by his interest in a flower. The stage-space reflects the growing intensity by adding movement on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Squares 2 and 3</a>. We learn in the <time datetime='00:57:45.000' title='00:57:45'> third part</time>, that it is while contemplating a flower at Lady Yūgao’s gate that Genji noticed her in the distance, and that their romantic encounter started with a flower presented on a fan. The pivotal nature of the moment is paralleled by the use of almost the entire stage-space. </p>
