    <p>
      The first module after the interlude is the beginning of the 'Waki Waits' section and the final energetic and intermedia arc. It will last for the full second act. It starts relatively simply with the waki singing accompanied by the drums in non-congruent style. But as he begins to quote a poem the relationship between the text and its rhythmic accompaniment coalesces and energy rises. Still, the overall expression is centered on a poem about a Confucian’s humble house.

        <p>The <em>kakaru</em> is spread over five eight-beat measures (<em>honji</em>). Half-way in the third one, the kotsuzumi player initiates <time datetime='00:40:12.000' title='00:40:12'> a switch from flexible to strict setting </time>, a motion recognizable by his much shorter <em>kakegoe</em>.  At this point, the percussionists also switch from the sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji"target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> to the more dynamic <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke"target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke</em></a> patterns. This change in the mode of performance coincides more or less with the beginning of the waki’s recitation of Tadamoto’s poem.
