      The point of intermedia interest in this <em>kakaru</em> centers on the relationship between the text and its rhythmic accompaniment.
      </p><p>
        At the sight of the neglected dwelling, the priest recites a poem written by Tachibana no Tadamoto (10th century) about two Confucius disciples Gannen and Genken, who pursued their spiritual studies in great poverty. The poem refers to <em> hyōtan</em> a variety of <em>iugao </em> that looks like <time datetime='00:40:09.000' title='00:40:09'>small gourds</time>, where the sentence ‘gourds are often empty’ is a metaphor for poverty.</p>

        <p>The <em>kakaru</em> is spread over five eight-beat measures (<em>honji</em>). Half-way in the third one, the kotsuzumi player initiate <time datetime='00:40:12.000' title='00:40:12'> a switch from flexible to strict setting </time>, a motion clearly perceptible by his much shorter <em>kakegoe</em>.  At this point, the percussionists also switch from the sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji"target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> to the more dynamic <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke"target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke</em></a> patterns. This change in the mode of performance coincides more or less with the beginning of the waki’s recitation of Tadamoto’s poem, thereby prompting the listener to attention.
