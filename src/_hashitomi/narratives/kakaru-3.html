  <p>On Square 8, stands a <em> tsukurimono </em> that represents what used to be Lady Yūgao’s dwelling. Standing on Square 5, the waki sings facing it.  The <em>kakaru</em> is spread over five eight-beat measures (<em>honji</em>). It starts relatively simply with the waki's singing a non-congruent <em>sashinori</em> chant accompanied by the drums in flexible rhythmic setting. Half-way in the third <em>honji</em>, the kotsuzumi player initiates  a <time datetime='00:39:55.000' title='00:39:55'> switch </time> from flexible to strict setting, a motion recognizable by his much shorter <em>kakegoe</em>. At this point, the percussionists also switch from the sparse <em>mitsuji</em> to the more rhythmic <em>tsuzuke</em>patterns. This change coincides more or less with a <time datetime='00:40:08.000' title='00:40:08'>switch in the text from prose to verse </time>, as the waki starts reciting a <a href="/text-hashitomi/#Waki-waits"  target="_blank"> poem</a>. Its content refers to a Confucian disciple and to ‘empty gourds’ serving  as a metaphor for poverty. This anticipates the theme of sadness that will weave through the next three <em>shōdan</em>. </p>
