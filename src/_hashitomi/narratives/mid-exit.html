      Hashitomiâ€™s shite is a young and elegant lady, thus her slow exit is well in character. She exits the stage in silence as it is the tradition with the Morita school of nohkan featured here. However, when the shite is a deity, as it is the case in <a href="/kokaji/raijo/" target="_blank">Kokaji</a>, his exit is accompanied with music.
