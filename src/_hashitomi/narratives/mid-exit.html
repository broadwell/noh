        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The shite slowly traverses the bridge, as he moves toward the Mirror room, where in preparation for the second act, he will change <em>kimono</em>. Even, as he walks out off the stage, the shite stays in character. The slow and quiet exit is well suited for a spirit of a lady.</div>

      Hashitomi’s shite is a young lady so her elegant, slow (minute-and-a-half) exit is suitable to be performed in silence as it is in tradition of Morita school. The shite’s exit can be sometimes accompanied by music. This is the case for instance in <a href="/kokaji/raijo/" target="_blank">Kokaji</a>, when the shite is a deity.
