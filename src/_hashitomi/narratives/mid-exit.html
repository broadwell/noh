      The shite’s exit is sometimes accompanied with music. This is the case for instance, when the shite is an important character such as a deity like in Kokaji (31:20). Hashitomi’s shite is a simple lady, hence her slow and dignified exit from the stage is unaccompanied, yet quite poignant as if time had been suspended. Indeed, her exit lasts a minute and a half.
