        <div class="section-introduction__definition"><p>The shite slowly traverses the bridge, as he moves toward the Mirror room, where in preparation for the second act, he will change <em>kimono</em>. Even, as he walks out off the stage, the shite stays in character. The slow and quiet exit is well suited for a spirit of a lady.</p></div>

      The shite’s exit is sometimes accompanied with music. This is the case for instance, when the shite is an important character such as a deity like in Kokaji. Hashitomi’s shite is a young lady, hence her slow and dignified exit from the stage is unaccompanied, yet quite poignant as if time had been suspended. Her exit lasts a minute and a half.
