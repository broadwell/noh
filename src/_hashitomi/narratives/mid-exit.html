        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The shite slowly traverses the bridge, as he moves toward the Mirror room, where in preparation for the second act, he will change <em>kimono</em>. Even, as he walks out off the stage, the shite stays in character. The slow and quiet exit is well suited for a spirit of a lady.</div>

    <p>
      The shite’s exit can be sometimes accompanied by music. This is the case for instance, when the shite is an important character such as the deity  <a href="/kokaji/raijo/" target="_blank">in Kokaji</a>. However, Hashitomi’s shite is a young lady so her elegant, slow (minute-and-a-half) exit is performed in silence.
