<section id="form" title="Form" class="tabbed-narrative">
    <p>It is composed of three superposed components articulated by the nohkan, percussion instruments, and the dance, respectively.<br>
      The nohkan provides a cyclical melodic background, and through its recurring patterns it articulates the dance’s five parts: jo, kakari, and the three sections.<br>
      Against the nohkan’s cycles of patterns, the choreography of the dance takes the shite across the stage during the <em>jo</em> and Third section. Displacement on stage being the main feature in these two parts, the dance’s focus is on the dancer’s lower body. On the other hand, the choreography of the First and Second sections involves less stage crossing, as the shite occupies different stage positions where he performs <em>kata</em> that involve the upper body.<br>
      Throughout the dance, the two percussion instruments play various functions that include, among others: bounding the dance and melodic components, controlling the gradual changes of speed, and articulating the dance’s structure. </p>

      <p>The beginning of the <em>jo no mai</em> is preceded by a transition that lasts one <em>honji</em>. The non-congruent chant sung by the jiutai accompanied by the two percussion instruments in <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> setting, introduces <time datetime='01:01:32.000' title='01:01:32'> the first line of the poem Genji wrote </time> in response to Lady Yūgao’s poem. The jiutai extends the poem’s last vowel over the next <em>honji</em> overlapping with the beginning of the <em>jo no mai</em>.</p>

      <p>The <em>jo</em> is spread over three <em>honji</em>. It is the only section of the dance that is non-congruent. The shite who is first facing back as he is getting prepared for the dance, finally pivots to face front, and after a sequence of Steps Forward, he signals the end of the <em>jo</em>, with a <time datetime='01:02:44.000' title='01:02:44'>Left Stamp</time> followed by the Open-retreat, a classic sequence used at the beginning of various dances. </p>

      <p><em>Kakari</em> can be translated as ‘introduction’, in the case of the <em>jo no mai</em> it refers to the nohkan introducing the dance’s core sequence of patterns called <em>ji</em>. It is composed of four eight-beat patterns, each one beginning on a second beat and a half of its corresponding <em>honji</em>. They are respectively labelled: <em>Chū</em>, <em>Kan</em>, <em>Kan no Chū</em>, <em>Ryo</em>, where <em>Kan no Chū</em> is either a variation or repetition of <em>Chū</em>. The melodic shape produced by this sequence is a four-<em>honji</em> long sinus wave with the <em>Chū</em> pattern in medium range, <em>Kan</em>in the higher range, then back to the medium range with the <em>Kan no Chū</em>, before reaching the lower range with the <em>Ryo</em>pattern. The  <em>Ji</em> pattern is played four times in this <em>kakari</em>.
      The <em>Ji's</em> four patterns are identifieed in the score with their first letter: C, K, KC, and R, for <em> Chū, Kan, Kan no Chū</em>, and <em>Ryo</em>, respectively.
    </p>

      <p>Each of the three sections is composed of two parts. Part-I introduces a phrase composed of a short sequence of new and recurring nohkan patterns. For instance, Part-I of the First section introduces a sequence of five patterns: <em>Dan, Kan no Chū, Oroshi, Chū, and Ryo</em>. Part-I of the Second section is almost identical except that the <em>Oroshi</em> is preceded by a <em>Ryo</em>: <em>Dan, Kan no Chū, Ryo, Oroshi, Kan no Chū, and Ryo</em>. All patterns are eight-beat long except for the <em>Oroshi</em> which lasts sixteen beats. Part-I of the Third section is slightly different, its sequence of patterns being: <em>Dan, Kan-chū, Ryo</em>, where all patterns are eight-beat long except for the <em>Dan</em> which lasts sixteen beats. </p>

      <p>All three sections are followed with two <em>Ji</em> plus one or two additional patterns. The structure of the <em>jo no mai</em> as performed by the Kongō school can be summarized as: </p>

<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">

  <p>We examine two points of intermedia interest in the <em> jo no mai</em>. The first one centers on how music and dance signal the opening and closing of a section. The second one focuses on the relationship between management of the stage’s space and the dance structure. </p>

  <p><strong>Closing and opening of a section</strong></p>

  <p>A dance always includes some specific <em>kata</em> that help articulate its structure. For instance, <em>kata</em> involving the fan are used to indicate the beginning of a section, while stamping is used to mark the end of one. To illustrate this point, we analyze the closing of the <em>kakari</em>, and the opening and closing Parts of Sections 1 and 2. </p>

  <p>The <em>kakari’s</em> closing sequence starts at its antepenultimate <em>honji</em> with the shite performing a sequence of three <em>kata</em>:<time datetime='01:07:45.000' title='01:07:45'> Left Stamp, Right Stamp and Scooping point </time>, followed in the next <em>honji</em> by the ōtsuzumi’s <em>shikake</em> pattern. Composed of six consecutive strokes, it is quite noticeable, and brings the listener to attention, and for a good reason, since the shite having performed his <em>kata</em> with a closed fan, produces the Opening of the Fan <em>kata</em> in the <em>kakari’s</em> last <em>honji</em>, signaling the beginning of the First section.<br>
  The closing feeling of this sequence is further reinforced with a rallentando that leads to the two percussionists’ <em>kakaegoe ‘iya’</em>. Heard for the first time, it come across as refreshing new material announcing the beginning of the First section.</p>

  <p>The closing of the First Section’s Part-I is also signaled with a <time datetime='01:09:48.000' title='01:09:48'> Left and Right Stamps </time> followed by the ōtsuzumi’s <em>shikake</em> pattern, as the shite performs an Open-retreat <em>kata</em> rather than a Scooping point. <br>
  The closing of the First Section’s Part-II is identical to the <em>kakari’s</em>: <time datetime='01:11:33.000' title='01:11:33'> Left Stamp, Right Stamp and Scooping point </time>, followed in the next <em>honji</em> by the ōtsuzumi’s <em>shikake</em> pattern.</p>

  <p>While the opening of Section I was underlined with the Opening the Fan <em>kata</em>, the beginning of Section II is signaled with a <time datetime='01:11:56.000' title='01:11:56'> Fan Reverse Hold and a Right Sleeve Flipped </time>, where the sleeve acts as an extension of the fan.
  The closing of the Second Section’s Part-I is also signaled with a <time datetime='01:13:31.000' title='01:13:31'> Left and Right Stamps </time> followed by the ōtsuzumi’s <em>shikake</em> pattern, leading to an Open-retreat <em>kata</em>. <br>
  The closing signals used at the Second Section’s Part-II are a variation of their preceding counterparts. For instance, the Left & Right Stamps are still used but separated by a <time datetime='01:15:08.000' title='01:15:08'> Right Back Step, a Left Circle, a Right Step Circlet </time>, while the <time datetime='01:15:18.000' title='01:15:18'> Left Sleeve Flipped </time> used to announce the opening of the Third Section, completes the sleeve flipping process started in the First Section’s Part-II.</p>

  <p>The Third Section closes the <em>jo no mai</em>. While the Opening of the Fan <em>kata</em> is used to signal the beginning of a section, Closing the Fan is used to signal the imminent end of a dance. Thus, the sequence of <em>kata</em> <time datetime='01:15:51.000' title='01:15:51'> Resetting of the Two Sleeves and Renesting of the Fan </time> performed at the beginning of the Third Section are clear signals that the dance is now starting its very last section.</p>

  <p><strong>Management of the stage’s space</strong></p>

  <p>An analysis of the <em>jo no mai</em> suggests that the dance's focus during the <em>kakari</em> and Third Section is on the dancer’s lower body, mainly the feet, since the movements involve primarily crossing the stage. On the other hand, the focus moves from the lower to the upper body in the First and Second Sections as the <em>kata</em> performed in these sections involve less stage crossing in favor of movements performed in specific stage’s locations.</p>

  <p>Kakari</p>

  <p>There are two important events in the <em><time datetime='01:03:21.000' title='01:03:21'>Kakari</time></em>: The nohkan player introduces its core sequence of four patterns called <em>Ji</em>, and the shite opens the stage-space. Holding a close fan in his right hand, he first traverses the right lateral (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares"target="_blank">Square 1 to 3</a>), then the front stage (Square 3 to 5), and finally the left-right transversal (Square 5 to 1).
  This trajectory does not only open-up the stage-space, it also creates a spatial wave of tension-release. Backstage positions such as Square 1 and 8, being further from the audience, are essentially positions of released tension. They are often used as starting and closing positions for a dance and its various sections. On the other hand, frontstage positions such as Square 3 and 4 and center-stage (Square 9), being closer to the audience, are essentially position of strength.
  Therefore, the motion Square 1 to 3 is building momentum since it brings the shite from a position of released tension, (Square 1) to the front (Square 3). The motion Square 3 to 5 maintains momentum since the dancer remains in the stage’s forefront. Finally, the motion (Square 5 to 1) releases tension, taking the shite from frontstage to backstage.  The opening of the stage space, which requires primarily foot motion keeps the dance’s focus on the dancer’s lower body.</p>

  <p>If we examined the <em>kakari’s</em> dance in greater details, we find that over for the span of the <em>kakari’s</em> first <em>Ji</em>, the shite standing on Square 1 performs a Small Zigzag, a <em>kata</em> often uses to open a dance. It is followed with two steps forward leading him to Square 2 where he performs a Simple Pivot followed with Ten Steps towards Square 3, thereby opening up the stage’s <time datetime='01:03:21.000' title='01:03:21'> right lateral </time>. </p>

  <p>At the beginning of the second <em>Ji</em> the shite standing at Square 3 performs a Simple Pivot before starting a sequence of Fifteen Steps towards Square 5, thereby opening up the front stage’s <time datetime='01:05:07.000' title='01:05:07'> traverse </time>. Having reached Square 5, he Makes an Angle and starts a sequence of Nineteen Steps towards Square 1, opening up the stage’s <time datetime='01:05:47.000' title='01:05:47'> Front-left Back-right diagonal </time>.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the third <em>Ji</em>, the shite has returned to his starting point: Square 1, thereby closing the opening loop. At this point, he concludes the <em>kakari</em> by performing a <time datetime='01:06:25.000' title='01:06:25'> sequence of <em>kata</em> </time> on Square 1, hence grounding it as an important point of departure and arrival, concluding with a Left Full Circlet Point, which is spread over the remaining part of the last <em>Ji</em>. </p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that the expansion of the stage-space of the <em>jo no mai</em> with its opening of the right lateral (Square 1 to 3), front stage (Square 3 to 5), and left-right transversal (Square 5 to Square 8) is identical to Kokaji’s maibataraki’s first section.</p>

  <p>First Section</p>
  <p>Shortly before the beginning of the First section the shite performs an <time datetime='01:08:13.000' title='01:08:13'> Opening of the Fan </time> <em>kata</em> that switches the dance focus from the lower body to the arms since <em>kata</em> performed with an open fan accentuate arms’ motion .</p>

  <p>The shite opens Part-I by building momentum with a <time datetime='01:08:32.000' title='01:08:32'> Medium Zigzag </time> that takes him from the resting Square 1 to the dynamic Square 3 , recalling the Small Zigzag that opened the <em>kakari</em>. As the tempo is slowing down during the <em>Oroshi</em>, the shite releases tension by performing four <em>kata</em> that bring him to the calmer Square 2.</p>

  <p>During Part-II’s first <em>Ji</em>, the shite reignites momentum by once again opening up the stage-space but this time with a <time datetime='01:10:18.000' title='01:10:18'> Large Zigzag </time> that takes him from Square 2 to Square 5 where he concludes this expansion with an Open-retreat followed with Two Steps forward that takes him to one of the stage’s strongest positions: Square 9. His arrival to center stage coincides more or less with the beginning of the <em><time datetime='01:11:09.000' title='01:11:09'> second Ji</time></em>.  Alternating between Square 9 and 4, the shite remains center-stage for the rest of the First section. </p>

  <p>Second Section</p>
  <p>The second section is the most active, it includes two tension-release waves, whereas the First section counted only one. Shortly before its beginning, the shite performed a Fan Reverse Hold and a <time datetime='01:11:56.000' title='01:11:56'> Right Sleeve Flipped </time><em>kata</em> leading to an extended draped right arm that moves the dance’s point of focus from the arms to the upper body. </p>

  <p>At the beginning of the Part-I, the shite performs a series of Step Pivot and Steps Back that keep him in center-stage. But as the tempo is slowing down and the percussion material is gradually thinning out leading to the <em><time datetime='01:12:48.000' title='01:12:48'>Oroshi</time></em>, the shite makes a release-tension move by taking Seven Steps Back from the strong Square 9 to the quieter Square 6. </p>

  <p>At the beginning of the first <em>Ji</em>, the shite starts <time datetime='01:14:02.000' title='01:14:02'>rebuilding momentum</time> by moving to the strong Square 3, where he Makes angle, yet this is immediately followed by a release-tension Thirtheen Steps that brings him backstage to Square 8, where he starts the second <em>Ji</em> occupying that space with a series of Circlets and Steps. But this retreat is also temporary. Energized by the accelerating tempo, the shite moves to the strong Square 9 and return to Square 3 where he performs a <time datetime='01:15:18.000' title='01:15:18'> Left Sleeve Flipped</time> <em>kata</em>. His two extended draped arms complete the move of the dance’s point of focus towards to the upper body. </p>

  <p>Third Section</p>
  <p>The Third <em>dan</em> is like a long cadential section that takes the shite from frontstage (Squares 3 and 5) to the quieter mid stage Square 2, followed with a return to frontstage (Squares 3 and 5) for a last release tension wave that will take him backstage to Square 8. </p>

  <p>During Part-I, the shite standing on Square 5, <time datetime='01:15:51.000' title='01:15:51'> Resets his Two Sleeves and Renests his Opened Fan</time> , and in doing so, switches the dance’s point of focus from the upper body to the arms, creating a release of tension that suggests that the dance is indeed coming to an end. This is accompanied by a move to the quieter Square 2 where he performs a Left Step Pivot and a Circle Point. </p>

  <p>He then starts the first <em>Ji</em> with a <time datetime='01:16:26.000' title='01:16:26'> Circlet point and a Take the corner with extended fan </time> on Square 3, followed by a Circle to 5, and after Making an angle on Square 5, the shite finally retreats to Square 8 where he concludes the dance with a <time datetime='01:17:06.000' title='01:17:06'> Right Small Circle </time> that brings him to Square 9 where he Raises his Fan in preparation for the recitation of the <em>Waka’s</em> poem. </p>

  <p>Although the Raised Fan <em>kata</em> can be performed anytime, it is usually performed as the shite sings a solo line in the <em>kuse</em>. By performing the Raised Fan <em>kata</em>, the shite who has been silent throughout the dance, is setting up an expectation that is further underlined by a sudden change of tempo. Controlled by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi players, the tempo gradually and steadily accelerates throughout the Third section to reach the dance’s fastest speed at its penultimate <em>honji</em>, where it drastically slows down in preparation for the slow <em>tome</em>, which in Hashitomi’s case, overlaps with the beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>waka</em>. </p>
