        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The <em>jonomai</em> as a pure dance, does not engage with the story. However, it represents a climax for the play by providing a vehicle for the actor and audience to project into the the movement dimensions of the play related to the iugao flower, Lady Yūgao and the emotions of her romantic affair with Genji.</div>

  <p>The intermedia of <em>jonomai</em> interweave closely choreography with music. This can be perceived as the matching of expressive qualities, synchronization of pacing, and the coordination of instrumental patterns with kata that outline the structure:
  <div class="introductory-table">
    <div class="introductory-table__element">
      <div class="introductory-table__term"><time datetime='01:01:57.000' title='01:01:57'>Jo</time></div>
      <div class="introductory-table__term"><time datetime='01:03:21.000' title='01:03:21'>Kakari</time></div>
      <div class="introductory-table__term"><time datetime='01:08:32.000' title='01:08:32'>First dan</time></div>
      <div class="introductory-table__term"><time datetime='01:12:12.000' title='01:12:12'>Second dan</time></div>
      <div class="introductory-table__term"><time datetime='01:15:39.000' title='01:15:39'>Third dan</time></div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The overall form of <em>jonomai</em> is perceived as cyclical primarily through repetitive patterns of the nohkan analyzed in in the <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/jonomai" target="_blank"><em>jonomai</em> page</a> of the Catalog of Shōdan and as seen in the score to the right. NOTE: The score uses the following abbreviations for musical segments in the nohkan part: <em>Chū</em> – C, <em>Kan</em> – K, <em>Kan no Chū</em> – KC, <em>Ryo</em> – R, <em>Oroshi</em> – Or and <em>Dan</em> – D.</p>

    <p>Similarly, drums and dance also mark formal sections by characteristic patterns and <em>kata</em>. For instance, <em>kata</em> involving the fan, sometimes accompanied by sleeve motion, are used to indicate the beginning of a section. Having performed the <em>Jo</em> and <em>Kakari</em> with a closed fan, the shite marks Dan 1 by <time datetime='01:08:13.000' title='01:08:13'> Opening of the Fan </time>. Dan 2 with a <time datetime='01:11:56.000' title='01:11:56'> Fan Reverse Hold and a Right Sleeve Flipped </time>, and Dan 3 with a <time datetime='01:15:51.000' title='01:15:51'>Renesting of the Fan and Resetting of the Sleeves</time>. Each opening of the <em>dan</em> is marked also by an extended 'iya' kakegoe of the ōtsuzumi.</p>

    <p>Stamping followed by the ōtsuzumi’s six consecutive strokes <em>shikake</em> pattern are used to articulate closing of sections. For example, the shite concludes the <em>kakari</em>  by performing a <time datetime='01:07:47.000' title='01:07:47'>Left Stamp and Right Stamp</time>, which is then followed by <em>shikake</em>.   The closing of the First Section’s Part-II is <time datetime='01:11:33.000' title='01:11:33'> identical</time>. Variations of that sequence of <em>kata</em> followed by the ōtsuzumi’s <em>shikake</em> pattern are used to conclude every section. Stamping is also used to close the <em><time datetime='01:12:48.000' title='01:12:48'>Oroshi</time></em> segment, which combines the slowdown of music with the dancer retreating back and stopping entirely. </p>

<p>As dance gradually expands the use of stage-space the music accelerates. For example, during the <em><time datetime='01:03:21.000' title='01:03:21'>Kakari</time></em>, during each of the consequitive <em>Ji</em> patterns of the nohkan the drumming gets faster, while the dancer gradually traverses the right lateral (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares"target="_blank">Square 1 to 3</a>), then the front stage (Square 3 to 5), and finally the left-right transversal (Square 5 to 1).</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that the expansion of the stage-space in <em>kakari</em> is identical to Kokaji’s first section of maibataraki dance.</p>
