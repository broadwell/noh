        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The Yūgao spirit’s narration begins the recitation of waka poem sent to her by Genji, brigning her deeply into memories of the time when she was with him. The <em>jonomai</em> as a pure dance, does not engage with the story. However, in the given context, it represents a climax for the play by providing a vehicle for the actor and audience to project into the movement, dimensions of the play related to the yūgao flower, Lady Yūgao and the emotions of the romantic affair with Genji.</div>

  <p>At the end of the <em>kuse</em>, the spirit of Lady Yūgao starts to recite the very first poem that Prince Genji wrote to her, but as if poetic words could not fully express her deepest feelings anymore, taken by emotions, she interrupts her recitation, and begins to dance. </p>

  <p>The elegant <em>jonomai</em> dance closely interweaves choreography with music. It is composed of five sections that can be accessed by clicking on their names below: </p>

  <p>The form of the <em>jonomai</em> is perceived as cyclical because it is primarily articulated through the nohkan’s <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/jonomai" target="_blank">repeated patterns</a>. The patterns are identified in the score below the video with the following legend: Chū – C, Kan – K, Kan no Chū – KC, Ryo – R, Oroshi – Or and Dan – D. </p>

  <p>While a dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em> are structured around salient mimetic <em>kata</em>, an instrumental dance does not. Instead, particular structural <em>kata</em> paired with vocal calls of the percussion play a specific formal function. For instance, <em>kata</em> involving the fan, sometimes accompanied by sleeve motion, are used to indicate the beginning of a section. Thus, having performed the <em>Jo</em> and <em>Kakari</em>  with a closed fan, the shite announces the upcoming beginning of the <em>First dan</em> by  <time datetime='01:08:13.000' title='01:08:13'>Opening of the Fan</time>, the beginning of the <em>Second dan</em> with a <time datetime='01:11:56.000' title='01:11:56'> Fan Reverse Hold and a Right Sleeve Flipped </time>, and the beginning of the <em>Third dan</em> with a <time datetime='01:15:25.000' title='01:15:25'>Left Sleeve Flipped</time>. The shite signals the dance's closing phase with <time datetime='01:15:51.000' title='01:15:51'> Renesting of the Fan and Resetting of the Sleeves</time>. While these <em>kata</em> anticipate the coming <em>dan</em>, the actual beginnings of the <em>dan</em> are marked by the extended <em> kakegoe 'iya'</em>, which within the congruent sections are reserved exclusively for this purpose. </p>

  <p>While arm motion involving the fan and sleeves and specific <em>kakegoe</em> are used to announce the beginning of a section, foot motion paired with a percussion pattern are used to articulate the closing. This is done by stamping followed by the ōtsuzumi’s six consecutive strokes <em>shikake</em>  pattern. For example, the shite concluded the <em>kakari</em>  by performing a <time datetime='01:07:47.000' title='01:07:47'> Left Stamp and Right Stamp</time> followed by <em>shikake</em>. The closing of the <time datetime='01:11:33.000' title='01:11:33'> First </time> and <time datetime='01:15:08.000' title='01:15:08'> Second </time> <em>dan</em> introduce variations on the stamping and a <em>shikake</em> sequence. </p>

  <p>The differences in the use of stage-space also help articulate the dance’s five-section structure. The <em>Jo</em> takes place exclusively on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a>. The <em>Kakari</em> and the Third <em>dan</em> see the shite dancing accross the whole stage, whereas <em>kata</em> in the First and Second <em>dan</em> involve just a few squares.</p>

  <p>The use of the stage-space in the <em>kakari</em> is worth additional note. The nohkan player introduces its core sequence of patterns called <em>Ji</em> that he repeats four times, while the shite opens the stage-space. Holding a closed fan in his right hand, the shite first traverses the right lateral over the first <em>Ji</em> – Squares 1 to 3, then the front stage over the second one – Squares 3 to 5, and finally the left-right transversal over the last two <em>Ji</em> – Squares 5 to 1. This trajectory does not only open the stage-space, it also creates a spatial wave of tension-release. Backstage positions such as Square 1 and 8, being further from the audience, are essentially positions of released tension. They are often used as starting and closing positions for a dance and its various sections. On the other hand, frontstage positions such as Square 3 and 4 and center-stage Square 9, being closer to the audience, are positions of strength. Therefore, the motion from Square 1 to 3 is building momentum since it brings the shite from a position of released tension in Square 1 to the front in Square 3. The motion from Square 3 to 5 maintains momentum since the dancer remains in the stage’s forefront. Finally, the motion from Square 5 to 1, releases tension, taking the shite from frontstage to backstage.  </p>

  <p>The choreography of the <em>kakari’s</em> exemplifies the overall modularity of Noh. The same stage-space use can be seen in both instrumental dances featured on this website: this slow and elegant <em>jonomai</em>, and the dynamic and virile <a href="/kokaji/maibataraki/" target="_blank"><em>maibataraki</em></a> in Kokaji. </p>

<p>Another intermedia formal pointer in the <em>jonomai</em> is the <em>Oroshi</em> pattern. It is quite recognizable aurally as it is a two-<em>honji</em>-long <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/jonomai#Oroshi" target="_blank">slow-down</a>, but also because the shite moves to a quieter stage position. For instance, in the First <em>dan’s Oroshi</em>, he takes <time datetime='01:09:07.000' title='01:09:07'> Four Step Back</time> to move from the dynamic Square 3 to the weaker Square 2. In the Second <em> dan’s Oroshi </em>, the shite performs a <time datetime='01:12:48.000' title='01:12:48'> release-tension</time> move by taking Seven Steps Back from the strong Square 9 to the quieter Square 6. </p>

  <p>A large scale intermedia closure can be observed at the end of the <em>shōdan</em>. The last and Third <em>dan</em> resembles a long cadential section that takes the shite from front stage (Squares 3 and 5) to the quieter Square 2, followed with a return to front stage (Squares 3 and 5) for a last tension-release wave that takes him back to Square 9.</p>

  <p>The shite concludes the dance by performing a <a href="/movement/raised-fan/" target="_blank">Raised Fan</a> <em>kata</em>. Although it can be performed anytime, it is usually seen as the shite raises attention when he sings the <em>ageha</em> solo line in the <em>kuse</em>. By performing the Raised Fan <em>kata</em> at the conclusion of the dance, the shite who has been silent throughout the <em>jonomai</em>, is by association setting up an expectation for chant. The transition is further underlined by a sudden change of tempo. Controlled by the percussionists, the tempo first gradually and steadily accelerates throughout the Third <em>dan</em> to reach the dance’s fastest speed at its penultimate <em>honji</em>. Then, it decidedly slows down in preparation for the slow <em>tome</em>, which in Hashitomi’s case, <time datetime='01:17:26.000' title='01:17:26'>overlaps</time> with the beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>waka</em>. </p>
