  <p>The percussion instruments play in <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> setting, offering a slow, sparse and open accompaniment appropriate for an unmetered duo. The monk singing in a non-congruent fashion, a <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori" target="_blank"><em>sashinori</em></a> chant to be more precise, <time datetime='00:17:52.000' title='00:17:52'> insists that the shite</time> reveals her name. The shite resists, replying in <a href="/music/voices/#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a> as if to stress her position. Yet, while keeping her actual identity secret, she goes as far as to confirm <time datetime='00:18:04.000' title='00:18:5204'> that she is no longer alive </time>. The <em>kakaru</em> concludes with the following <time datetime='00:18:24.000' title='00:18:24'>two lines</time>:</p>

  <p><em>“At a certain mansion,<br>
    I could always be found, indeed it is so.”</em></p>

    <p>Those familiar with the <em>Genji monogatari</em> will remember that Lady Yūgao’s dwelling is described as surrounded with a fence filled  with ‘evening face’ flowers. Although at this point in the play the actual identity of the shite’s character’s identity is still unknown, one could speculate about it, as the monk appears to be doing. Indeed, the last two lines form a single sentence that should have been sung by the woman. Yet, it is the monk who sings the first line, suggesting that he may have a hunch about her identity. The sentence is then completed by the woman in singing mode, <time datetime='00:18:33.000' title='00:18:33'>as she turns towards the monk</time>, as if acknowledging his intuition. This coincides with a change in the character of the percussion material, moving from sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> to the regular <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke</em></a> pattern, a <time datetime='00:17:58.000' title='00:17:58'>switch</time> that subtly increase the density emphasizing the <em>shōdan’s</em> closing and raising expectation about the one to come.</p>
