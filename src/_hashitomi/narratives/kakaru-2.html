    <p>
        The last <em>shōdan</em> of the 'Dialogue' section in Act 1 stays rather simple but sees the intermedia texture enriched by the return of the drums accompaniment, and by the mixing of <em>kotoba</em> and chant. The dramatic intensity grows as a new clue for the identity of the main character is introduced.

      </p><p>
     The percussion instruments play in <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> setting, offering a slow, sparse and open accompaniment appropriate for a free conversation. The monk, <time datetime='00:17:52.000' title='00:17:52'> insists on the shite to reveal her identity</time>by singing in a non-congruent fashion. Replying in <em>kotoba</em>, the shite resists but goes as far as to confirm <time datetime='00:18:04.000' title='00:18:5204'> that she is no longer alive </time>. She keeps her actual identity secret.</p>
        <p>The <time datetime='00:18:24.000' title='00:18:24'>conclusion</time> of the <em>kakaru</em> consists of two lines:</p><p><em>“At a certain mansion,<br> I could always be found, indeed it is so.”</em></p><p> They refer to Lady Yūgao’s mansion whose fence was covered with ‘evening face’ flowers, and as such, give a clue to the shite's identity. The fact that it is the monk who sings the first line suggests that he may be guessing who the apparition is. The sentence is completed by the woman in a singing mode, <time datetime='00:18:33.000' title='00:18:33'>as she turns towards the monk</time>.
        This coincides with a change in the character of the<time datetime='00:18:20.000' title='00:18:20'> percussion material </time>, moving from sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> to the regular <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke</em></a> pattern. This switch subtely adds momentum to the music as important information is being presented.
