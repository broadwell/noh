      The scene is shaped by the combination of story-telling and the way the text is used to bound together the two protagonists.
      </p><p>
        The first act’s ‘Dialogue’ part closes with a <em>kakaru</em>, whose beginning is clearly marked by the entrance of the percussion instruments in flexible setting. The priest singing in a non-congruent fashion, <time datetime='00:17:52.000' title='00:17:52'>presses the shite to reveal her identity</time>. Replying in <em>kotoba</em>,  the shite goes as far as to confirm <time datetime='00:18:04.000' title='00:18:5204'> that she is no longer alive </time>, but keeps the mystery on her actual identity.
        The conclusion of the <em>kakaru</em> deserves a special mention. The last sentence is <time datetime='00:18:24.000' title='00:18:24'>“At a certain mansion, I could always be found, indeed it is so.”</time>. This is a reference to Lady Yūgao’s mansion whose fence was covered with ‘evening face’ flowers, and such, a clue on the shite’s identity. Thus, this line should have been delivered by the shite, yet it is the priest who sings its first part, completed by the shite in singing mode, <time datetime='00:18:33.000' title='00:18:33' as he turns towards the priest</time>.  It is interesting that as the mystery on the shite’s identity was about to be partially lifted, the text assignment ends up creating some ambiguity.
      </p><p>
        This important clue on the shite’s identity coincides with a switch in the percussion material <time datetime='00:18:20.000' title='00:18:20'> from sparse <em>mitsuji</em> to the regular <em>tsuzuke</em> pattern </time>, a move that adds momentum to the music and call the listener to attention, as important information is being presented.
