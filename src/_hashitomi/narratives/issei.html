          <em>honji</em>, and it is over the first one that the setting switches from flexible to strict. The change can be perceived by <em>kakegoe</em> since the extended calls used by the ōtsuzumi player, reminiscent of the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> setting, are answered by the kotsuzumi player with shorter ones, redolent of the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">strict</a> setting. This switch leads to the introduction of the non-congruent <time datetime='00:41:25.000' title='00:41:25'> nohkan’s </time> <em>mi roku no ge</em> pattern, which itself leads to the beginning of the <time datetime='00:42:08.000' title='00:42:08'>chant</time>, a duo for shite and jiutai.

      <p>The <em>issei</em>-chant introduces the first sung duo involving the jiutai.  It is composed of nine <em>honji</em>, the first four are sang by the shite, the last five by the jiutai.
      Based on two different poems, the text assignment creates an interesting counterpoint as the recitation of the poems is started by one character, and completed by another one, a process already introduced in the preceding <em>kakaru</em>.</p>

      <p><em>Kakaru</em></p>
      <p>The waki sang the first two lines of Tadamoto’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:40:09.000' title='00:40:09'>"Hyōtan shibashiba munashi, Kusa Gannen ga chimata shigeshi"</time></em>.</p>

      <p><em>Issei</em></p>
      <p>The shite takes over the delivery of Tadamoto’s poem as he sings its third line: <em><time datetime='00:42:15.000' title='00:42:15'>"Reijō fukaku tozaseri"</time></em>, but rather than finishing the poem, he introduces the first two lines of Saga’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:42:49.000' title='00:42:49'>"Sekiyō no zansei aratani, Mado wo ugattesaru"</time></em>.</p>

      <p>Then, the jiutai completes Saga’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:43:35.000' title='00:43:35'>"Shiutan no izumi no koe"</time></em>, before singing the last two lines of Tadamoto’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:43:57.000' title='00:43:57'>"Ame Genken ga, toboso wo uruō su"</time></em>.</p>
