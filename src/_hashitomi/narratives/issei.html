      The <em>issei</em>-chant introduces the first sung duo involving the jiutai.  It is composed of nine <em>honji</em>, the first four are sang by the shite, the last five by the jiutai.
      The text plays a unifying function since the first line of the shite’s text carries on the rendition of Tadamoto’s poem started by the waki in the preceding <em>kakaru</em>.</p>

      <p>Indeed, the shite recites the poem’s third line <time datetime='00:42:15.000' title='00:42:15'>“Reijō fukaku tozaseri” </time> before moving on to the <time datetime='00:42:48.000' title='00:42:48'> first two lines of a poem by the Emperor Saga (786-842)</time>. The <time datetime='00:43:36.000' title='00:43:36'> third and last line</time>of this last poem is sung by the jiutai, whose next two lines returns to and complete the initial <time datetime='00:43:58.000' title='00:43:58'>Tadamoto’s poem</time>. Hence, once again text is used to unite the characters.
