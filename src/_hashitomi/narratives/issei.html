        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The entrance <em>issei</em>-music occupies the <em>issei’s</em> first three of twelve <em>honji</em>. During the first one the rhythmic setting of percussion switches from <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> to strict. The change can be perceived by the character of the <em>kakegoe</em> with the first two extended calls used by the ōtsuzumi player, reminiscent of the flexible setting, answered by the kotsuzumi player with shorter ones, redolent of the strict setting. This switch leads to the introduction of the non-congruent nohkan’s <time datetime='00:41:25.000' title='00:41:25'> <em>mi roku no ge</em></time> pattern, which then leads to the beginning of the <time datetime='00:42:08.000' title='00:42:08'>chanted</time> exchange between the shite and the jiutai. The <em>einori</em> chant is delivered in <a href="/music/voices#Yowagin" target="_blank"><em>yowagin</em></a> style.

      <p>The 'Shite Re-enters' section gradually increases the intermedia richness. The <em>issei</em>-music sees once again a development from flexible to strict rhythmic setting of the drums and then gains further presence by the arrival of the nohkan. The movement of the actors remains extremely simple but the texture gets richer as the chant alternates between shite and the jiutai, and poetic texts are passed around between them. A five-line poetic text is based on two intertwined poems from two different authors. The first three lines are delivered by the shite, the last two by the jiutai.</p>

      <p><em>Issei</em>-chant is composed of nine <em>honji</em>, the first four are sung by the shite, the last five by the jiutai.
      Based on two different poems, the text assignment creates an interesting counterpoint as the recitation of the poems is begun by one character, and completed by another one, a process started in the preceding <em>kakaru</em>, where the waki sang the first two lines of Tadamoto’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:40:09.000' title='00:40:09'>"Hyōtan shibashiba munashi, Kusa Gannen ga chimata shigeshi"</time></em>. The shite takes over the delivery of the poem in <em>issei</em>, as he sings its third line: <em><time datetime='00:42:15.000' title='00:42:15'>"Reijō fukaku tozaseri"</time></em>, but rather than finishing the poem, he introduces the first two lines of Saga’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:42:49.000' title='00:42:49'>"Sekiyō no zansei aratani, Mado wo ugattesaru"</time></em>. Then, the jiutai completes Saga’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:43:35.000' title='00:43:35'>"Shiutan no izumi no koe"</time></em>, before singing the last two lines of Tadamoto’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:43:57.000' title='00:43:57'>"Ame Genken ga, toboso wo uruō su"</time></em>.</p>
      <p>Three parts (the waki, the shite, and the jiutai) take turns while two poems written in Chinese style are recited. This brings about the feeling as if three voice parts were merged in one only to make the recitation of poems impersonal.</p>
