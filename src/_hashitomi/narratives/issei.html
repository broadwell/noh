          <em>honji</em>. During the first one the rhythmic setting of percussion switches from flexible to strict. The change can be perceived by the character of the <em>kakegoe</em> with the frist two extended calls used by the ōtsuzumi player, reminiscent of the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> setting, being answered by the kotsuzumi player with shorter ones, redolent of the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">strict</a> setting.

The chant in yowagin style is in non-congruent setting.

      <p>The 'Shite Re-enters' section increases the intermedia richness gradually. The <em>issei</em>-music sees once again a development from flexible to strict rhythmic setting of the drums and then gains further presence by the arrival of the nohkan. The movement of the actors remains extremely simple but the texture gets richer as the chant introduces the sung duo involving the jiutai and the shite, and poetic texts are passed around between actors. </p>

      <p><em>Issei</em>-chant is composed of nine <em>honji</em>, the first four are sung by the shite, the last five by the jiutai.
      Based on two different poems, the text assignment creates an interesting counterpoint as the recitation of the poems is begun by one character, and completed by another one, a process started in the preceding <em>kakaru</em>, where the waki sang the first two lines of Tadamoto’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:40:09.000' title='00:40:09'>"Hyōtan shibashiba munashi, Kusa Gannen ga chimata shigeshi"</time></em>. The shite takes over the delivery of the poem in <em>issei</em>, as he sings its third line: <em><time datetime='00:42:15.000' title='00:42:15'>"Reijō fukaku tozaseri"</time></em>, but rather than finishing the poem, he introduces the first two lines of Saga’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:42:49.000' title='00:42:49'>"Sekiyō no zansei aratani, Mado wo ugattesaru"</time></em>. Then, the jiutai completes Saga’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:43:35.000' title='00:43:35'>"Shiutan no izumi no koe"</time></em>, before singing the last two lines of Tadamoto’s poem: <em><time datetime='00:43:57.000' title='00:43:57'>"Ame Genken ga, toboso wo uruō su"</time></em>.</p>
