        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The entrance <em>issei</em>-music occupies the <em>issei’s</em> first three of twelve <em>honji</em>. During the first one the rhythmic setting of percussion switches from <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> to strict. The change can be perceived by the character of the <em>kakegoe</em> with the first two extended calls used by the ōtsuzumi player, reminiscent of the flexible setting, answered by the kotsuzumi player with shorter ones typical for the strict setting. This switch leads to the introduction of the non-congruent nohkan’s <em><time datetime='00:41:25.000' title='00:41:25'> mi roku no ge</time></em> pattern, which then leads to the beginning of the <time datetime='00:42:08.000' title='00:42:08'>chanted</time> exchange between the shite and the jiutai. The <a href="/music/voices#Einori" target="_blank"><em>einori</em></a> chant is delivered in <a href="/music/voices#Yowagin" target="_blank"><em>yowagin</em></a> style.

  <p>The <em>issei</em>-music differs from the preceding <em>shōdan</em> with the switch in the percussion instruments’ rhythmic setting from flexible to <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">strict</a>,  and the completing of the <em>hayashi</em> by the addition of the nohkan. This change prepares a further qualitative shift toward the poetic.</p>

<p>The <em>issei</em>-chant, introduces an interesting counterpoint of two poems that are intertwined and recited by two actors passing lines between them. The process starts in the preceding <em>kakaru</em>, where the waki sings the first two lines of the <time datetime='00:39:23.000' title='00:39:23'>first poem</time>. Then, the shite opens the <em>issei</em>-chant by singing the poem’s <time datetime='00:42:15.000' title='00:42:15'>third line</time>. Rather than finishing it, he introduces the first two lines of a <time datetime='00:42:48.000' title='00:42:48'>second poem</time>. It is the jiutai who <time datetime='00:43:35.000' title='00:43:35'>completes</time> the second poem with its last line, before singing the <time datetime='00:43:57.000' title='00:43:57'> last two lines</time> of the first. The process is summarized in this figure:</p>

<p>The sharing of a poetic line (albeit composed from two poems) between three different 'actors' signals an important moment in the overall structure. It marks the definite turning away from fact-based story telling to more abstract aesthetics of poetry, music and eventually pure dance. </p>

<p>It is interesting to note that although the waki’s participation in the singing is over at this point in the play, he is still an active player. For instance, the moment the shite starts chanting from inside the <em>tsukurimono</em> the waki <time datetime='00:42:26.000' title='00:42:26'>slides on his knee</time> to face it. By showing that he can hear the voice he adds to its materiality despite it produced from an invisible source. Alternatively, it could indicate that everything continues to happen in the mind of the monk.</p>
