  <p>The very short <em>waka</em> is both a contrast and a bridge between the two major <em>shōdan</em>:  the <em>jonomai</em> and the <em>kiri</em>. It releases tension built by the intense aestheticism of pure dance and prepares for a narrative ending. </p>

  <p>The intermedia richness temporarily drops. After the <em>jonomai</em>, which had the shite perform many structural kata and use most of the stage-space, <em>waka</em> limits the movement to one gesture while standing still on one square.  A held Raised Fan <em>kata</em> and the position being at the center, allows the shite to retain some energy and exert command of the stage. The music brings back chanting and keeps most energy of strict percussion rhythms but the nohkan drops off after finishing the last pattern from <em>jonomai</em>. The <time datetime='01:17:40.000' title='01:17:40'>melisma </time> of shite's non-congruent <a href="/music/voices/#Einori" target="_blank"><em>einori</em></a> chant extend the
dance's aesthetic focus and recalls the highly ornamented slow nohkan melody.</p>
<p>The percussion forms another bridge between the two rhythmically congruent but divergent <em>shodan</em>. The <em>jonomai</em>'s slow speed had a free-flowing temporal feeling that was well suited for the dance of an elegant young lady. It will be in clear contrast with the steady-beat ōnori chant of the jiutai in the <em>kiri</em>. In the <em>waka</em> between them, the drums start by two <em>honji</em> of broad and sparse <time datetime='01:17:26.000' title='01:17:26'><em>mitsuji</em> patterns</time> then, they acellerate toward the  <time datetime='01:17:52.000' title='01:17:52'>last two</time> <em>honji</em>  of <em>tsuzuke</em> pattern. At the same time the initial extended <em>kakegoe</em> of the ōtsuzumi player that seemed to imply a flexible setting are answered by short <em>kakegoe</em> of the kotsuzumi player. By the time they play <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns they are both in strict rhythm setting up the beat for ōnori.
