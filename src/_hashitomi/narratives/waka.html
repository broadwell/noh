  <p>The short <em>waka</em> has two points of intermedia interest: How the text assignment bounds the two protagonists, and the bridging effect of the percussion accompaniment.</p>

  <p>The text of this <em>waka</em> is the poem Genji wrote in response to the verse Lady Yūgao sent him on a scented fan. The shite already delivered its <time datetime='01:01:31.000' title='01:01:31'>first line</time> <em>“orite koso”</em> at the end of the <em>kuse</em>, but its declamation was then interrupted by the <em>jo no mai</em>. During the <em>waka</em> the shite sings the poem’s <time datetime='01:17:25.000' title='01:17:25'> first three lines</time>, the <time datetime='01:18:15.000' title='01:18:15'> remaining two lines</time> being sung by the jiutai at the beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>kiri</em>. Thus, Genji is personified by the shite during the <em>waka</em>, and by the jiutai at the beginning of the <em>kiri</em>.</p>

  <p>This non-congruent <em>waka</em> sits between two major <em>shōdan</em>:  the <em>jo no mai</em> and the <em>kiri</em>, and as such, it serves as a bridge between the two. Although the outer two <em>shōdan</em> are both congruent, their type of congruency differs substantially. Indeed, the <em>jo no mai’s</em> level of congruency is quite loose compared to the <em>kiri’s</em>. Its slow speed paired with the highly ornamented nohkan’s melody creates a free-flowing temporal structure that is well suited for the dance of an elegant young lady, but in clear contrast with the <em>kiri’s</em> steady beat.</p>

  <p>There is an interesting transformation in the <em>waka’s</em> percussion material that bridges the two congruent <em>shōdan</em>. More specifically, the percussion material subdivides the <em>waka’s</em> four <em>honji</em> in half, with the first two <em>honji</em> articulated with <em>mitsuji</em>  <time datetime='01:17:26.000' title='01:17:26'>patterns</time>, whereas the <time datetime='01:17:52.000' title='01:17:52'>last two</time> switches to <em>tsuzuke</em> <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke</em></a> patterns.</p>

  <p>The <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> pattern divides the <em>honji</em> in two four-beat parts, the first one articulated by the ōtsuzumi with a stroke on the <em>honji’s</em> third beat, whereas the second half belongs to the kotsuzumi with strokes on the fifth, seventh, and eighth beats.<br>
  It is the <em>kakegoe</em> used by the two percussionists that show that their rhythmic settings do not match. Indeed, the extended one used by the ōtsuzumi player indicates that his material is <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a>, in contrast with the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">strict</a> setting of the  kotsuzumi characterized by his short <em>kakegoe</em>. Their overlapping <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke</em></a> patterns starting at the third <em>honji</em> pulls them both into strict setting. </p>

  <p>This transformation of the percussion material is in counterpoint with the setting of the text. Indeed, the shite delivers the first two lines of the poem over the first two <em>honji</em> keeping the Raised Fan in front of his face. Then, completing the interrupted Raised Fan <em>kata</em>, he extends the delivery of the poem’s third line over the last two <em>honji</em> just as the percussion material switches to <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns, thus stressing the importance of that line: <em>“Tasokare ni</em> /  in the twilight”, a reference to the fact that it is in the ‘shadow of the moonlight flower’ that Genji first set sights on Lady Yūgao.</p>
