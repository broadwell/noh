  <p>The short <em>waka</em> has two points of intermedia interest: the text assignment used to bound two protagonists, and the bridging effect of the percussion accompaniment.</p>

  <p>The text of this <em>waka</em> is the poem Genji wrote in response to the verse Lady Yūgao sent him on a scented fan. The shite delivered its <time datetime='01:01:31.000' title='01:01:31'> first line </time> <em>“orite koso”</em> at the end of the <em>kuse</em>, but his declamation was then interrupted by the <em>jo no mai</em>. During the <em>waka</em> the shite sings the poem’s <time datetime='01:17:25.000' title='01:17:25'> first three lines</time>, the <time datetime='01:18:15.000' title='01:18:15'> remaining two lines</time> being sung by the jiutai at the beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>kiri</em>. Thus, Genji is personified by the shite during the <em>waka</em>, and by the jiutai at the beginning of the <em>kiri</em>.</p>

  <p>This non-congruent <em>waka</em> sits between two major <em>shōdan</em>:  the <em>jo no mai</em> and the <em>kiri</em>, and as such, it serves as a bridge between the two. Although they are both congruent, their type of congruency differs substantially. Indeed, the <em>jo no mai’s</em> level of congruency is quite loose compared to the <em>kiri’s</em>. Its slow speed paired with the highly ornamented nohkan’s melody creates a free-flowing temporal structure that is well suited for the dance of an elegant young lady, but in clear contrast with the <em>kiri’s</em> steady beat.</p>

  <p>There is an interesting transformation in the <em>waka’s</em> percussion material that bridges the two congruent <em>shōdan</em>. More specifically, the percussion material subdivides the <em>waka’s</em> four <em>honji</em> in half, with the first two <em>honji</em> articulated with <time datetime='01:17:25.000' title='01:17:25'> <em>mitsuji</em> patterns </time>, conversely to <time datetime='01:17:52.000' title='01:17:52'> <em> tsuzuke</em> patterns </time> for the last two.</p>

  <p>The <em>mitsuji</em> pattern divides the <em>honji</em> in two four-beat parts, the first one articulated by the ōtsuzumi with a stroke on the <em>honji’s</em> third beat, whereas the second half belongs to the kotsuzumi with strokes on the fifth, seventh, and eighth beats.
  It is the <em>kakegoe</em> used by the two percussionists that show that their rhythmic setting do not match. Indeed, the extended one used by the ōtsuzumi player indicates that his material is fleexible, in contrast with the strict setting of the  kotsuzumi characterized by his short <em>kakegoe</em>. Their overlapping <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns starting at the third <em>honji</em> pulls them both into strict setting. </p>

  <p>This transformation of the percussion material is in counterpoint with the setting of the text. Indeed, the shite delivers the first two lines of the poem over the first two <em>honji</em> keeping the Raised Fan in front of his face. Then, completing the interrupted Raised Fan <em>kata</em>, he extends the delivery of the poem’s third line over the last two <em>honji</em> just as the percussion material switches to <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns, thus stressing the importance of that line: <em>“Tasokare ni</em> /  in the twilight”, a reference to the fact that it is in the ‘shadow of the moonlight flower’ that Genji first set sights on Lady Yūgao.</p>
