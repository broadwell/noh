  <p> With its text set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied the percussion instruments in strict rhythm, the <em>sageuta</em> is the first of a sequence of five consecutive congruent <em>shōdan</em>. The text of the second act has definitely shifted from prose to verse.</p>
  <p>A nostalgic tone sets in. It started with the <em>issei’s</em>  <time datetime='00:43:57.000' title='00:43:57'> last line </time>: “<em>Rain dampens Genken's (Yüan Hsien) gate</em>.”, where rain is a metaphor for tears. It continues in the <em>sageuta</em> which starts with another metaphor for tears: <time datetime='00:44:42.000' title='00:44:42'> dampened sleeves </time>. This will then be carried over to the <em>ageuta</em>  with a reference to the <time datetime='00:45:40.000' title='00:45:40'>limpid moon</time> soaring over a desolate evening. The source of the nostalgia is only revealed in the following <em>shōdan</em> – the <em>rongi</em>, when the shite asks “<em><time datetime='00:48:48.000' title='00:48:48'> When will they meet again?</time></em>”, a clear and poignant reference to a lover's yearning. </p>

  <p>The positioning of this short chant between the <em>issei</em>-chant and the <em>ageuta</em> is better appreciated when considering the ondulating shape of the vocal line across the three <em>shōdan</em>. By starting the <em>sageuta</em> in the low register, it completes the descending trajectory from high to medium of the <em>issei</em>-chant. Its motion up towards the medium range serves as a transition towards the high range of the coming <em>ageuta</em>. </p>
