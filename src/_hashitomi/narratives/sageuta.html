    <p>
      The point of intermedia interest with the <em>shōdan</em> centers on how the <em>sageuta</em>  transitions  rhythmic organization, register, and mood from the <em>issei</em> to the following <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>ageuta</em>.</p>

      <p>The rhythmic setting of the chant moves from the non-congruent <em>issei</em> to congruent. Moreover, the starting low register of the <em>sageuta</em> chant completes the <em>issei</em> chant’s descending register trajectory from high to medium, while its own motion up towards the medium range serves as a nice transition towards the high range of the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>ageuta</em>. The <em>sageuta</em> introduces also a change of density in the vocal part. From the <em>issei’s</em> duo for shite and jiutai, the <em>sageuta</em> is sung by the shite, while the following <em>ageuta</em>, the last <em>shōdan</em> of the Shite re-enters part, will be delivered by the jiutai.</p>

      <p>Finally, as the text of the second act is gradually moving from factual information to poetry, a tone of sadness and nostalgy is gradually sinking in. The process started with the <em>issei’s</em> last line: <time datetime='00:43:57.000' title='00:43:57'>“Rain dampens Genken's (Yüan Hsien) gate.”</time>, where rain is a metaphor for tears.
      It is carried over in the <em>sageuta</em> which start with another metaphor for tears: <time datetime='00:44:43.000' title='00:44:43'>dampened sleeves</time>. This will then be carried over in the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>ageuta</em> with a reference to the limpid moon soaring over a desolate evening.
      In fact, one has to wait until the <em>rongi</em> to understand the source behind this sadness when the shite asks <time datetime='00:48:48.000' title='00:48:48'>“When will they meet again?” </time>, a clear yet poignant reference to her beloved Genji, whom she is still yearning for.</p>
