      Two stage assistants bring in very slowly a rather mysterious object, <a href="/staging/props/#Hashitomi" target="_blank"><em>tsukurimono</em></a> a rectangular cube covered with a curtain and with a thatched roof on top representing a delapidated dwelling. It will be later revealed that it inside it was hidden the shite and that it contained a symbolic entrance gate to a house. The gate is hung with <em>hashitomi</em>, and evening flowers and gourds creeping over it. <em>Hashitomi</em> means ‘half <em>shitomi</em>’, an oblong wooden panel shutter, the upper edge of which is hinged and the loose lower end can be pushed open.
