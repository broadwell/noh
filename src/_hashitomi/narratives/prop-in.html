        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The <a href="/staging/props/#Hashitomi" target="_blank"><em>tsukurimono</em></a>, a rectangular cube covered with a curtain and with a thatched roof on top. It is brought in by two stage assistants and placed in front of the two percussionists on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 8</a>. It will be later revealed that inside it is hidden the shite and that it represents a delapidated dwelling. Its symbolic entrance gate is hung with a <em>hashitomi</em>, the source of the play's title. <em>Hashitomi</em> means ‘half <em>shitomi</em>’, an oblong wooden panel shutter, the upper edge of which is hinged and the loose lower end can be pushed open. Iugao evening flowers and gourds creep over it.</div>
