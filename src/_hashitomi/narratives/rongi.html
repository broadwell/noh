    <p>The intermedia intensity in the Dialogue section rises. After the spirit reveals her name, the gate of the dwelling is raised and we get to see her face (mask) and full form. The shite walks out revealing her shape and opening the stage space. He and the jiutai are now accompanied by the full hayashi with the nohkan underlining the emergence of Lady Yūgao assiting the transition to next shōdan.</p>


     <p>The two performers also speak from four points of view. First the jiutai speaks for the monk when it asks the main character <time datetime='00:47:38.000' title='00:47:38'>to reveal her identity</time>. Facing front as if for everyone to hear, the shite who at this point personifies Lady Yūgao recites <time datetime='00:48:08.000' title='00:48:08'>a poem</time> that she wrote to Genji, a reference to the <em> Genji monogatari</em>. As she concludes her recitation, she turns to the jiutai as if hoping for an answer when she asks <time datetime='00:48:50.000' title='00:48:50'>“When will they ever meet again?”</time>. As she turns right to face the front, the jiutai speaks for her, when it recites <time datetime='00:49:03.000' title='00:49:03'> another poem also authored by Lady Yūgao </time> that she addressed to her first lover, Tō no Chūjō, thus she concludes the poem’s <time datetime='00:49:23.000' title='00:49:23'> recitation </time>.</p><p>
      Then, the jiutai continue to speak for Lady Yūgao as it asks a question for the monk, <time
      datetime='00:49:38.000' title='00:49:38'> “If I reveal the form…”</time>. At this point, she once again turns left to face the jiutai who now stands for the monk, as she completes the question “...will you pray for my soul ?”.
      The jiutai speaking for the monk affirms that <time datetime='00:49:59.000' title='00:49:59'> he will</time>.</p><p>
      Upon hearing this confirmation, the woman turns right to face the full audience and reveals her identity: <time datetime='00:50:06.000' title='00:50:06'> “the ‘evening face’”</time>. It is at this point that the jiutai becomes the fourth character: <time datetime='00:50:33.000' title='00:50:33'>a narrator</time>, describing Lady Yūgao coming out of the <em>tsukurimono</em>. As she steps out and reveals her form, the monk honors his promises <time datetime='00:51:24.000' title='00:51:24'>and prays for her</time>.</p>

      <p>The nohkan performer plays only once in the shōdan, performing a variation on the <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"><em>mi roku no ge</em></a> pattern as the jiutai is singing its very last line, which follows the shite stepping out of the <em> tsukurimono </em>. Besides bringing the corresponding text to prominence and giving it emotional depth: “At the sight tears flow without stopping.”, the entrance of the nohkan also works as a smooth transition leading to an <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"><em>uchikiri</em></a> that serves as a bridge to the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>kuse</em>.
