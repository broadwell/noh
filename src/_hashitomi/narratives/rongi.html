      This <em>rongi</em> has two points of intermedia interest: The first one relates to the text and how it puts into play four characters; the second one looks at how the entrance of the nohkan helps underline the text.</p>

      <p>Although the sung dialogue involves two protagonists: the shite and the jiutai, the text suggests the presence of four participants. First the jiutai speaks for the waki when it asks the shite <time datetime='00:47:38.000' title='00:47:38'><em> to reveal her identity</em></time>. Facing front as if for everyone to hear, the shite recites <time datetime='00:48:08.000' title='00:48:08'>a poem that Lady Yūgao wrote to Genji </time>, a reference to the <em> Genji monogatari</em>. As she concludes her recitation, she turns to the jiutai as if hoping for an answer as she asks <time datetime='00:48:50.000' title='00:48:50'>“When will they ever meet again?”</time>.
      As the shite turns right to face the front, the jiutai speaks for her, as it recites <time datetime='00:49:03.000' title='00:49:03'> another poem also authored by Lady Yūgao </time> that she addressed to her first lover, Tō no Chūjō, but it is the <time datetime='00:49:23.000' title='00:49:23'> shite who concludes the poem’s recitation </time>.
      Then, the jiutai speaks for the shite as it initiates a question for the waki, <time
      datetime='00:49:38.000' title='00:49:38'> “If I reveal the form…”</time>. At this point, the shite once again turns left to face the jiutai who now stands for the waki, as she completes the question <time datetime='00:49:51.000' title='00:49:51'> “...will you pray for my soul ?”</time>. The jiutai speaking for the waki affirms that <time datetime='00:49:59.000' title='00:49:59'> he will</time>.
      Upon hearing this confirmation, the shite turns right to face the full audience and reveals her identity: <time datetime='00:50:06.000' title='00:50:06'> “the ‘evening face’”</time>. It is at this point that the jiutai becomes the fourth character: <time datetime='00:50:32.000' title='00:50:32'>a narrator</time>, describing the shite coming out of the <em>tsukurimono</em>. As she steps out and reveals her form, the waki honors his promises <time datetime='00:51:24.000' title='00:51:24'>and prays for her</time>, performing the same <time datetime='00:8:32.000' title='00:8:32'>prayer gesture</time> he did when performing the memorial service for flowers in the first <em>kakaru</em>.</p>

      <p>The nohkan player plays only once in this <em>rongi</em>, performing a variation on the <a href="/music/nohkan/Mirokunoge"><em>mi roku no ge</em></a> pattern as the jiutai is singing its very last line, which follows the shite stepping out of the <em> tsukurimono </em>. Besides bringing the corresponding text to prominence: “At the sight tears flow without stopping.”, the entrance of the nohkan also works as a smooth transition leading to an <a href="/music/Otsuzumi&Kotsuzumi/Uchikiri"><em>uchikiri</em></a> that serves as a bridge to the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>kuse</em>.
