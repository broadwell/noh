      This <em>rongi</em> has two points of intermedia interest: The first one relates to the text and how it puts into play four characters; the second one looks at how the entrance of the nohkan helps underline the text.</p>

      <p>Although the sung dialogue involves two protagonists: the shite and the jiutai, the text suggests the presence of four participants.</p><p>
      First the jiutai speaks for the monk when it asks the main character <time datetime='00:47:38.000' title='00:47:38'>to reveal her identity</time>. Facing front as if for everyone to hear, the shite who personifies Lady Yūgao recites <time datetime='00:48:08.000' title='00:48:08'>a poem</time> that she wrote to Genji, a reference to the <em> Genji monogatari</em>. As she concludes her recitation, she turns to the jiutai as if hoping for an answer as she asks <time datetime='00:48:50.000' title='00:48:50'>“When will they ever meet again?”</time>.</p><p>
      As she turns right to face the front, the jiutai speaks for her, as it recites <time datetime='00:49:03.000' title='00:49:03'> another poem also authored by Lady Yūgao </time> that she addressed to her first lover, Tō no Chūjō, thus she concludes the poem’s <time datetime='00:49:23.000' title='00:49:23'> recitation </time>.</p><p>
      Then, the jiutai continue to speak for Lady Yūgao as it asks a question for the monk, <time
      datetime='00:49:38.000' title='00:49:38'> “If I reveal the form…”</time>. At this point, she once again turns left to face the jiutai who now stands for the monk, as she completes the question “...will you pray for my soul ?”.
      The jiutai speaking for the monk affirms that <time datetime='00:49:59.000' title='00:49:59'> he will</time>.</p><p>
      Upon hearing this confirmation, the woman turns right to face the full audience and reveals her identity: <time datetime='00:50:06.000' title='00:50:06'> “the ‘evening face’”</time>. It is at this point that the jiutai becomes the fourth character: <time datetime='00:50:33.000' title='00:50:33'>a narrator</time>, describing Lady Yūgao coming out of the <em>tsukurimono</em>. As she steps out and reveals her form, the monk honors his promises <time datetime='00:51:24.000' title='00:51:24'>and prays for her</time>.</p>

      <p>The nohkan player plays only once in this <em>rongi</em>, performing a variation on the <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"><em>mi roku no ge</em></a> pattern as the jiutai is singing its very last line, which follows the shite stepping out of the <em> tsukurimono </em>. Besides bringing the corresponding text to prominence: “At the sight tears flow without stopping.”, the entrance of the nohkan also works as a smooth transition leading to an <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"><em>uchikiri</em></a> that serves as a bridge to the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>kuse</em>.
