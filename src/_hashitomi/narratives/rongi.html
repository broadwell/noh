    <p>The intermedia intensity in the Dialogue section rises. After the spirit mentions the name Yūgamo, the gate of the dwelling is raised and we get to see her face (the shite's mask) and full figure. The shite walks out opening the stage space to the front. The shite and the jiutai are now accompanied by the full hayashi with the nohkan underlining the emergence of the Yūgao spirit and assiting in the smooth transition to the next <em>shōdan</em>.</p>


     <p>While the shite speaks solely for Lady Yūgao the jiutai speaks for her, for the monk and as a narrator. The jiutai speaks for the monk when it asks the main character <time datetime='00:47:38.000' title='00:47:38'>to reveal her identity</time>. Facing front as if for everyone to hear, Lady Yūgao recites <time datetime='00:48:08.000' title='00:48:08'>a poem</time> that she wrote to Genji, a reference to the <em>Genji monogatari</em>. As she concludes, she turns to the waki and asks <time datetime='00:48:50.000' title='00:48:50'>“When will they ever meet again?”</time>. As she turns right to face the front, the jiutai speaks for her, when it starts reciting <time datetime='00:49:03.000' title='00:49:03'> another poem that she authored. She then conludes the <time datetime='00:49:23.000' title='00:49:23'> recitation </time>.</p><p>
      Then, the jiutai continues to speak for her as it asks a question for the monk, <time datetime='00:49:38.000' title='00:49:38'> “If I reveal the form…”</time>. At this point, she once again turns left to face the waki, as she completes the question “...will you pray for my soul?”.
      The jiutai speaking for the monk affirms that <time datetime='00:49:59.000' title='00:49:59'> he will</time>.</p><p>
      Upon hearing this confirmation, she turns right to face the full audience and mentions her name: <time datetime='00:50:06.000' title='00:50:06'> “the ‘evening face’”</time>. It is at this point that the jiutai becomes the third character: <time datetime='00:50:33.000' title='00:50:33'>a narrator</time>, describing Lady Yūgao coming out of the <em>tsukurimono</em>. As she steps out and reveals her fullfigure, the monk honors his promise <time datetime='00:51:24.000' title='00:51:24'>and prays for her</time>.</p>

      <p>The nohkan performer plays only once in the shōdan, performing <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"><em>mi roku no ge</em></a> pattern as the jiutai describes Lady Yūgao and she steps out of the <em> tsukurimono </em>. Besides bringing the corresponding text to prominence and giving it emotional depth: “At the sight tears flow without stopping.”, the entrance of the nohkan also works as a smooth transition leading to an <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"><em>uchikiri</em></a> that serves as a bridge to the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>kuse</em>.
