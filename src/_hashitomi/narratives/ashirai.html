      The entrance of the shite is preceded by very slow but intense music that builds up anticipation of the mysterious appearance. Only the percussion accompanies the waki as he walks to his pole. The expression of his gait serves as a preparation, it helps establish the right energy to bring in the shite.  The nohkan begins to play at the second <em>honji</em>. Its haunting melodic patterns ‘summon’ the apparition and help establish its mysterious beauty. </p>
      <p>The timing and gesture of curtain lifting depends on the shite. After waiting for the right moment, the way the shite utters <em>omaku</em> suggests to the stage assistant the manner, in which the lifting is to be executed. In the featured performance the shite waited until the third <em>honji</em>, which gave more time for the music to set the proper mood.
      As he enters the bridge, he purposely avoids facing the audience delaying the moment he will show the mask's full face. He walks very slowly, taking three minutes to reach the First Pine. At this point, the curtain goes down as slowly as it was lifted. Only as he is about to sing <time datetime='00:12:23.000' title='00:12:23'>, does he turn </time> toward the audience, thus revealing the mask that can be admired as the entrance music is coming to an end.
      </p><p>

      For the entire <em>shōdan</em>, the free-flowing nohkan’s melody is supported by an equally free percussion obbligato consisting only of sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns played in <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> mode. The absence of periodic pulsations provides the music with an unsettling feeling, which matches well the spirit of a dream and an otherworldly appearance.
