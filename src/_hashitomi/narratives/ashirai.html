      The entrance of the shite is preceded by very slow but intense music that builds up anticipation of the mysterious appearance. Only the percussion accompanies the waki as he walks to his pole. The expression of his gait serves as a preparation, it helps establish the right energy to bring in the shite.  The nohkan begins to play with the second honji. It’s haunting melodic patterns ‘summon’ the apparition and help establish its mysterious beauty. The timing and gesture of curtain lifting depends on the shite. After waiting for the right moment, the way the shite utters ‘omaku’ suggests to the stage assistant the manner, in which the lifting is to be executed. In the featured performance the shite waited for the third honji, which gave more time for the music to do its work. He walks extremely slowly and makes his appearance more gradual by not facing the audience for the first three minutes and showing only side of the mask. Upon him reaching the First Pine the curtain goes down as slowly as it was lifted. Only as the shite prepares to sing <time datetime='00:12:23.000' title='00:12:23'>he turns </time> toward the audience. An arrival point at the First Pine in a middle of a honji and full revealing of the mask that then is admired during an additional closing honji, is a typical variant of a shite entrance.

      For the entire shōdan, the free-flowing nohkan’s melody is supported by an equally free percussion material consisting only of sparse mitsuji patterns played in flexible mode. The absence of periodic pulsations provides the music with an unsettling feeling, which matches well the spirit of a dream and an otherworldly appearance.
