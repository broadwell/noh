    <p>The preceding 'Waki Enters' section has set the scene for the arrival of the main actor. The chanting ceased and the waki emptied the space by moving from the center of the stage to his post on Square 5. With very deliberate walking movement of both actors accompanied only by instrumental music the intermedia texture becomes plain and sparse again. 'Shite Enters' section and the second arch of gradual dramatic and intermedia build-up is beginning. It will be longer than the first and it will reach its peak in the following "Dialogue" section.</p>

    <p>
      Overlapping from the previous scene, a very slow percussion music accompanies the waki as he walks to his pole. Its expression together with waki's gait help create anticipation for the arrival of shite. The main character will appear seemingly out of nowhere. The nohkan begins to play at the second <em>honji</em>. Its haunting melody ‘summons’ the apparition and helps define its enigmatic beauty. </p>

      <p>The timing and gesture of curtain lifting depends on the shite. After waiting for the right moment, the way the shite utters <em>omaku</em> suggests to the stage assistant the manner, in which the lifting is to be executed. In the featured performance the shite waited until the third <em>honji</em>, which gave more time for the music to set the proper mood.</p>

      <p>As the shite enters the bridge, he purposely avoids facing the audience. He is delaying the moment of showing the mask in full face. He walks very slowly, taking three minutes to reach the First Pine. At this point, the curtain goes down as slowly as it was lifted. Only as he is about to sing <time datetime='00:12:23.000' title='00:12:23'>, does he turn </time> toward the audience, thus revealing the mask that can be admired as the entrance music is coming to an end. Not entering the stage may imply that the apparation remains invisible to the monk.
      </p><p>

      For the entire <em>shōdan</em>, the free-flowing nohkan’s melody is supported by an equally free percussion accompaniment consisting only of sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns played in <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> mode. The absence of periodic pulsations provides the music with an unsettling feeling, which matches well the spirit of a dream and an otherworldly appearance.
