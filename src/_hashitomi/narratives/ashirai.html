  <p>The end of the preceding 'Waki Enters' <em>dan</em> has set the scene for the arrival of the main actor. The chanting has ceased and the waki has left the center-stage for his post on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 5</a>. The shite’s entrance music starts with the percussion instruments in flexible mode performing a slow music composed of sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns. It is at the second <em>honji</em> that the nohkan joins the them with a variation of the non-congruent <a href="/music/nohkan/rokunoge" target="_blank"><em>roku no ge</em></a> pattern. </p>

  <p>The timing and gesture of curtain lifting depends on the shite's cue. After waiting for the right moment, the way the shite utters <em>omaku</em>  suggests to the stage assistant the manner in which the lifting is to be executed. In the featured performance the shite waited until the third <em>honji</em>  before giving his signal, providing the music with more time to set the proper mood.</p>

  <p>The main character finally appears seemingly out of nowhere as if the haunting free-flowing melody with its reserved ornamentation had set a humble yet refined tone that ‘summons’ her apparition and helped define her enigmatic beauty. The absence of periodic pulsations provides the music with an unsettling feeling, which matches well the spirit of a dream inspired by this otherworldly appearance.</p>

  <p>As the shite enters the bridge, the curtain goes down as slowly as it was lifted. He walks very slowly, taking two minutes to reach the First Pine, delaying the showing of the mask in full face. Only as he is about to sing <time datetime='00:12:23.000' title='00:12:23'>does he turn </time> toward the audience, thus revealing the mask that can be admired as the entrance music is coming to an end. Not having entered the stage proper may imply that the apparition still remains invisible to the monk.</p>
