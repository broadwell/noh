  <p>As the monk is about to perform a memorial service for flowers, he asserts its importance by moving to the center stage (Square 9).  Coming from the energetically weaker Square 1, he opens up the stage space and activates one of the most powerful positions. Interestingly, even the shite will not enter that area in the first act limiting his actions to the quieter Squares 1 and 2.  This approach is not standard. A more typical position used by other waki schools would be <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares"target="_blank">Square 5</a>.

  In the first three lines, the monk professes respect for the flowers, delivering his praises in <em>kotoba</em>. In the fourth one, the emphasis changes from flowers in general to specifically the lotus. In Buddhism, its ability to rise from murky waters to produce a beautiful and pure flower is symbolically associated with enlightenment.<br>
  The recitation of a sutra is always delivered in a sung fashion, thus the monk switches from spoken to singing mode. Reflecting on the lotus plant, he recites the Lotus Sutra: <em>sōmoku kokudo shi’kai jōbutsudō</em> (plants, trees, all on earth, achieve Buddhahood). The <em>sashinori</em> setting of the chant with its recitative style is well suited for the delivery of a religious text.
  </p><p></p><p>
  At the conclusion of the scene, the monk performs a prayer gesture similar to the one used to close the <em>nanori</em>. This time it has a spiritual connotation as it is performed while the monk is singing the sutra. It is excecuted with <time datetime='00:08:32.000' title='00:08:32'>joined opened hands and rounded arms</time> unlike in <em>nanori</em> when it was  <time datetime='00:06:29.000' title='nanori'>performed with closed fists and straight arms</time>.The <time datetime='00:08:57.000' title='08:57'>separation of hands</time> at the end is always <time datetime='00:06:33.000' title='06:33'>asymmetric</time>. <p>
  It is interesting to note that actors stay in character even when performing an out-of-character gesture. For instance, the <time datetime='00:09:01.000' title='09:01'>motion of the sleeve</time> is technically needed to avoid wrinkling, yet it is always done in character.
