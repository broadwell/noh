<br   />performs a prayer gesture.<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">

  <p>While the <em>nanori ‘s</em> narrative has set up a story that provides a reason for the shite to appear, the <em>kakaru</em> increases momentum leading to his entrance.  More prominent stage position, increased instrumentation, and changing style of vocal delivery contribute to a substantially raised Intermedia Index. The elevated energy will be released with the shite’s appearance.</p>

  <p>The monk asserts the importance of the memorial service by moving to the center stage (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 9</a>). Coming from the energetically weaker Square 1, he opens up the stage space and activates one of the most powerful stage positions. Interestingly, not even the shite will enter that area in the entire first act, limiting his actions to the quieter Squares 1 and 2.</p>

  <p>This <em>shōdan</em> also marks the first entry of the two hand percussion instruments who accompanies the non-congruent vocal part, with sparse sounds of the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a>
patterns performed in <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> rhythmic setting.</p>

  <p>In the first three lines, the monk professes respect for the flowers, delivering his praises in <a href="/music/voices/#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a>. In the fourth one, he focuses specifically on the <time datetime='00:07:45.000' title='00:07:45'>lotus</time>. In Buddhism, its ability to rise from murky waters to produce a beautiful and pure flower is symbolically associated with enlightenment. In Noh, the recitation of a sutra is always delivered in a sung fashion, thus the monk switches at that point from spoken to singing mode. He recites the Lotus Sutra: <em>sōmoku kokudo shi’kai jōbutsudō </em> (plants, trees, all on earth, achieve Buddhahood). The <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori" target="_blank"><em>sashinori</em></a> setting of the chant with its recitative style is well suited for the delivery of a religious text.</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of the scene, the monk performs a prayer gesture similar to the one used to close the <em>nanori</em>. This time, it has a spiritual connotation as it is performed while the monk is singing the sutra. It is done by joining <time datetime='00:08:32.000' title='00:08:32'>open hands with rounded arms</time> unlike in <em>nanori</em> when it was performed with <time datetime='00:06:29.000' title='nanori'>closed fists and straight arms</time>. The separation of hands at the end is always <time datetime='00:06:33.000' title='06:33'>asymmetric</time>. </p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that actors always stay in character. For instance, the <time datetime='00:09:01.000' title='09:01'>motion of the sleeve</time> can be technically needed only to avoid wrinkling of the costume, but it is done 'as a monk'.</p>
