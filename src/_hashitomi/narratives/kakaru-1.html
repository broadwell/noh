<br   />performs a prayer gesture.<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">

  <p>While the <em>nanori ‘s</em> narrative has set up a story that provides a reason for the shite to appear, the <em>kakaru’s</em> function is to increase momentum leading to his entrance.  Stage position, instrumentation, and mode of delivery of the text contribute to substantially increase the Intermedia Index of this <em>shōdan</em>, lifting its energy that will be released with the shite’s appearance.</p>

  <p>The monk asserts the importance of the memorial service by moving to the center stage (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 9</a>). Coming from the energetically weaker Square 1, he opens up the stage space and activates one of the most powerful stage positions. Interestingly, even the shite will not enter that area in the first act limiting his actions to the quieter Squares 1 and 2.</p>

  <p>This <em>shōdan</em> also marks the first entry of the two hand percussion instruments who accompanies the non-congruent vocal part, with sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a>
patterns performed in <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> rhythmic setting.</p>

  <p>It is in his first three lines that the monk professes respect for the flowers, delivering his praises in <a href="/music/voices/#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a>. In the fourth one, the emphasis changes from flowers in general to specifically the <time datetime='00:07:45.000' title='00:07:45'>lotus</time>. In Buddhism, its ability to rise from murky waters to produce a beautiful and pure flower is symbolically associated with enlightenment. The recitation of a sutra is always delivered in a sung fashion, thus the monk switches from spoken to singing mode. Reflecting on the lotus plant, he recites the Lotus Sutra: <em>sōmoku kokudo shi’kai jōbutsudō </em> (plants, trees, all on earth, achieve Buddhahood). The <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori" target="_blank"><em>sashinori</em></a> setting of the chant with its recitative style is well suited for the delivery of a religious text.</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of the scene, the monk performs a prayer gesture similar to the one used to close the <em>nanori</em>. This time it has a spiritual connotation as it is performed while the monk is singing the sutra. It is executed with <time datetime='00:08:32.000' title='00:08:32'>joined opened hands </time> and rounded arms unlike in <em>nanori</em> when it was  performed with <time datetime='00:06:29.000' title='nanori'>performed with closed fists</time> and straight arms. The separation of hands at the end is always <time datetime='00:06:33.000' title='06:33'>asymmetric</time>. </p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that actors stay in character even when performing an out-of-character gesture. For instance, the <time datetime='00:09:01.000' title='09:01'>motion of the sleeve</time> is technically needed to avoid wrinkling, yet it is always done in character.</p>
