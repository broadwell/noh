  <p>As the priest is about to perform a memorial service for flowers, he asserts its importance by moving to the center stage (Square 9).  Coming from the energetically weaker Square 1, he opens up the stage space and activates one of the most powerful positions. Interestingly, even the shite will not enter that area in the first act limiting his actions to the quieter Squares 1 and 2.  This approach is not standard. A more typical position used by other waki schools would be Square 5.
  </p><p></p><p>
  In the first three sentences, the priest professes respect for the flowers, delivering his praises in kotoba. In the fourth phrase, the emphasis changes from flowers, in general, to specifically the lotus. Its ability to rise from murky waters to produce a beautiful and pure flower is symbolically associated in Buddhism with enlightenment. At this point the waki switches from speaking to singing, as he  <time datetime='00:07:45.000' title='00:07:45'>reflects on the lotus plant</time>. The change of delivery mode is related to the change to poetic text. The scene ends with a regularly sung Lotus Sutra: <em>sōmoku kokudo shi’kai jōbutsudō</em> (<em>… plants, trees, all on earth, achieve Buddhahood</em> ). The sashinori setting of the chant with its recitative style is well suited for a religious text.
  </p><p></p><p>
  At the conclusion of the scene, the waki performs a prayer gesture similar to the one used to close the nanori. This time it has a spiritual connotation as it is performed while the priest is singing the sutra. It is performed with <time datetime='00:08:32.000' title='00:08:32'>joined opened hands and rounded arms</time> unlike in nanori when it was  <time datetime='00:06:29.000' title='nanori'>performed with closed fists and straight arms</time>.The <time datetime='00:08:57.000' title='08:57'>separation of hands</time> at the end is always <time datetime='00:06:33.000' title='06:33'>asymmetric</time>. <p>
  The <time datetime='00:09:01.000' title='09:01'>motion of the sleeve</time> is technically needed to avoid wrinkling, but the motion is always in character.
