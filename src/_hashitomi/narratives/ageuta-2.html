            <p>The <em>ageuta</em> is the last module of the Shite re-enters part, and although we heard him sing in the preceding <em>shōdan</em>, his appearance is completed in this module as the drape around the <a href="/staging/props/#Hashitomi" target="_blank"><em>tsukurimono</em></a> is removed.</p>
    <p>
      This <em>ageuta</em> has two points of intermedia interest: a missing nohkan’s pattern, and the first dance-to-text movement (<em>kata</em>).</p>

      <p>As it is typical of an <em>ageuta</em>, its first sentence is repeated, its iteration being preceded by an <em> <time datetime='00:46:03.000' title='00:46:03'>uchikiri</time></em>
      during which one would expect to hear the nohkan’s <em>takane</em> pattern. It is the absence of the pattern that brings the listeners to attention, as the drape around the <em><time datetime='00:46:15.000' title='00:46:15'>tsukurimono</time></em> is about to be removed.</p>

      <p>In a context where so little is happening as it is the case when a shite is sitting, small details gain in importance. For instance, as the jiutai sings “beyond the hedge, the autumn mountains”, <time datetime='00:46:49.000' title='00:46:49'>the shite slides to the right to better admire them </time>. Although this mimicking dance movement is the first one in the play, it will abound in the coming <em>kuse</em>.
