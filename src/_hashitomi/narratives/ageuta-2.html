            <p>The <em>ageuta</em> is the last module of the Shite Re-enters <em>dan</em> and its highest intermedia point. Although we heard the shite sing in the preceding <em>shōdan</em>, his slow but dramatic appearance is completed as the drape around the <a href="/staging/props/#Hashitomi" target="_blank"><em>tsukurimono</em></a> is removed. The spirit has now a visual identity.  </p>
      <p>As it is typical of an <em>ageuta</em>, its first sentence is repeated, its second iteration being separated by an <em> <time datetime='00:46:03.000' title='00:46:03'>uchikiri</time></em>. This process of reiteration creates momentum for the subsequent melodic motion from high to the higher note called <em>kuri</em>. The first words of the fourth line <em>‘Shu u sho o’</em> allude to Autumn developing the theme of sadness that appeared in previous modules. </p>

      <p>This conicindes with the first mimetic movements of the second act. In a context of minimal motion such as when a shite is sitting, small details gain in importance. For instance, as the jiutai sings “beyond the hedge, the autumn mountains”, <time datetime='00:46:49.000' title='00:46:49'>the shite slides to the right as if to better admire them </time>.
