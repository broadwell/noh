    <p>
      This <em>ageuta</em> has two points of intermedia interest: a missing nohkan’s pattern, and the first dance-to-text movement (<em>kata</em>).</p>

      <p>As it is typical of an <em>ageuta</em>, its first sentence is repeated, its iteration being preceded by an <time datetime='00:46:03.000' title='00:46:03'><em> uchikiri </em></time>
      during which one would expect to hear the nohkan’s <em>takane</em> pattern. It is the absence of the pattern that brings the listeners to attention, as the drape around the <time datetime='00:46:15.000' title='00:46:15'><em>tsukurimono</em></time> is about to be removed.</p>

      <p>In a context where so little is happening as it is the case when a shite is sitting, small details gain in importance. For instance, as the jiutai sings “beyond the hedge, the autumn mountains”, <time datetime='00:46:49.000' title='00:46:49'><em> </em> the shite slides to the right to better admire them </time>. Although this mimicking dance movement is the first one in the play, it will abound in the coming <em>kuse</em>.
