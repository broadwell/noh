            <p>The <em>ageuta</em> is the last module of the Shite re-enters part and its highest intermedia point. The jiutai picks up the congruent singing accompanied by the strict percussion. Although we heard the shite sing in the preceding <em>shōdan</em>, his slow but dramatic appearance is completed as the drape around the <a href="/staging/props/#Hashitomi" target="_blank"><em>tsukurimono</em></a> is removed and he begins to do some mimetic movements.</p>
The beginning of the <em>shōdan</em> is marked by a striking change of vocal color from shite solo to the jiutai.

      <p>As it is typical of an <em>ageuta</em>, its first sentence is repeated, its iteration being preceded by an <em> <time datetime='00:46:03.000' title='00:46:03'>uchikiri</time></em>
      during which one would expect to hear the nohkan’s <em>takane</em> pattern. It is the absence of the pattern that brings the listeners to attention, as the drape around the <em><time datetime='00:46:15.000' title='00:46:15'>tsukurimono</time></em> is about to be removed.</p>

      <p>In a context of minimal motion like when a shite is sitting, small details gain in importance. For instance, as the jiutai sings “beyond the hedge, the autumn mountains”, <time datetime='00:46:49.000' title='00:46:49'>the shite slides to the right as if to better admire them </time>. This first mimetic movement in the second act will lead to many more in the coming <em>kuse</em>.
