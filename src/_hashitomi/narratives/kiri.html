  <p>The final shōdan of the play consolidates the energy of the play utilizing most of its intermedia resources. The shite and jiutai sing in an active tempo, in the most forceful congruent style (<em>ōnori</em>), accompanied by drums in strict rhythm. The movement takes place in very prominent central stage positions (Squares 3, 4, and 9) and combines structural <em>kata</em> with mimetic dimension in association with text. The poetic text uses repetition for additional emphasis. In the closing passage the nohkan performs the <em>tome</em> pattern in a variant which adds the extreme high pitch <em>hishigi</em>.</p>

  <p> To illustrate this the <em>kiri</em> can be divided in two parts: the first, completes Genji's poem and emphatically acknowledges Lady Yūgao as the apparition, the second, mimetically narrates among others her disappearance with metaphoric reference to Genji's parting at dawn.</p>

  <p>When finishing the poem, the jiutai sings three times its last line: <em> “hana no iugao</em>  /the flowering 'evening face'”, thus stressing the words “<em>iugao</em> / evening face", the nickname Genji gave to the lady he saw in the shadow of the white flower. In addition to repetition the text is emphasized through powerful <em>ōnori</em> style of singing and its syllabic setting. The seven syllables of the line are laid over a single <em>honji</em> for the <time datetime='01:18:32' title='01:18:32.000'>first two iterations </time>, but are spread over two when uttered for the third time. The association of the name with the spirit is symbolically affirmed by the actor being positioned prominently at the center-stage and performing a classic sequence of structural <em>kata</em>: Medium zigzag, Forward pointing, and an Open-retreat.</p>

<p>In the second part, the text, movement and music collaborate for mimetic purposes. Over the words: <em>"Kane mo shikiri ni.</em> /The tolling of the bells”, the shite turns left (East in Kongō tradition) and looks up as if to appreciate the rising sun. In loose synchronization with his words the kotsuzumi’s patterns include upbeat attacks leading to first or fifth beat of the <em>honji</em>, and although these patterns are not unique to Hashitomi, they could be read as mimicking the tolling of the <time datetime='01:20:43.000' title='01:20:43'>bells</time>.  Then, with a Forward Point, he points in the direction of the bells and as he sings <em>“Tsuge wataru shinonome.</em> / …announce the coming of dawn.”, he performs a Flipped Left Sleeve  and a <time datetime='01:20:55' title='01:20:55.000'> Cloud Fan </time> – a pattern often used to suggest looking into the distance.</p>

  <p>In the final section, the shite enters the <em>tsukurimono</em> as the nohkan joins and announces the <time datetime='01:22:36' title='01:22:36.000'>imminent end of the play</time> with its closing <a href="/music/nohkan/tomenote" target="_blank"><em>tome</em></a> pattern. Then, the shite moves his Fan to Left Hand in preparation for a <time datetime='01:22:53.000' title='01:22:53'>Pillow Fan</time>, a pattern that suggests disappearance, which he performs as the jiutai sings <em>“sono mama yume to zo nari ni keru. </em>/ …becoming one with the dream.”. </p>
