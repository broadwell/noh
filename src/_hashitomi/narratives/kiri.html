        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The very last module (<em>shōdan</em>) of a play, the <em>kiri</em> is a sung dialogue between the shite and the chorus, and a dance-to-text. It can be divided into two parts: Part-I acts as a bridge between the <em>waka</em> (the preceding module) and the <em>kiri</em> proper.  Part-II includes the call and response between the two singing bodies and the dance-to-text.</div>

  <p>The points of intermedia interest in the <em>kiri</em> center on rhythmic setting to emphasize important text, and on how mimicking <em>kata</em> are used to provide the text with a visual representation, a technique also used in the <em>kuse</em>.</p>

  <p>Hashitomi’s <em>kiri</em> is preceded by a <em>wak</em>a during which the shite, standing for Genji, recited the first three lines of the poem he wrote to Lady Yūgao, the night he first laid eyes on her. The <em>kiri’s</em> Part-I opens up with the jiutai, now standing for Genji, delivering the last two lines of the same poem, while the shite standing center stage performs a sequence of opening <em>kata</em>: Medium zigzag, Forward pointing, and an Open-retreat.
  The jiutai repeats three times the poem’s last line: <em> “hana no iugao</em>  /the flowering “evening face””, thus stressing the words “<em>iugao</em> / evening face’, the nickname Genji gave to the lady he saw in the shadow of the white flower.
  The text is not only emphasized through repetition but also through its rhythmic setting. Indeed, its seven syllables laid over a <em>honji</em> for the <time datetime='01:18:32' title='01:18:32.000'>first two iterations </time>, are spread over two for the third utterance.</p>

  <p>Part-II opens up with the first out of three interventions by the shite. The first two exchanges between the shite and the jiutai carry the farewell words of Lady Yūgao. The shite standing center stage and speaking for Lady Yūgao delivers a two-<em>honji</em> long solo on a <time datetime='01:19:21' title='01:19:21.000'>single pitch with a slow steady pulse</time>, accompanied by sparse <em>mitsuji</em> patterns by the two hand-percussion instruments. As the jiutai, also speaking for Lady Yūgao, replies with a one-<em>honji</em> long melodic line of three pitches sung at a much faster speed and accompanied by steady percussion’s <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns, the shite performs a <time datetime='01:19:54' title='01:19:54.000'> Simple Left Pivot </time> to face the waki as the jiutai is begging him to pray for her. Then, as the jiutai is announcing the coming of dawn, the shite takes three steps towards the strong Square 4 in preparation for the last exchange which leads into the dance-to-text.</p>

  <p>The last exchange between the shite and the jiutai puts in parallel the coming of dawn with the disappearance of Lady Yūgao, just like Genji who after having spent the night with her, would disappear in the early morning hours.
  Like her two preceding vocal lines, this one is also rhythmically and melodically static. Once again, the percussion instruments use sparse mitsuji patterns to support the shite’s solo. Yet, the kotsuzumi’s patterns include upbeat attacks that either lead to first or fifth beat of the <em>honji</em>, and although these patterns are not idiosyncratic to Hashitomi's <em>kiri</em>, their loose synchronization with the words <em>"Kane mo shikiri ni</em> / the tolling of the bells" suggests that they could be read as mimicking the rhythmic motion of the <time datetime='01:20:39' title='01:20:39.000'> bells </time>. </p>

  <p>In Noh, east is associated with the stage's left side, so it is over the words: <em>"Kane mo shikiri ni.</em> /The tolling of the bells”, that the shite turns left and looks up to appreciate the rising sun.
  Then with a Forward Point, she points in the direction of the bells and performs a Flipped Left Sleeve  and a <time datetime='01:20:55' title='01:20:55.000'> Cloud Fan </time> as he sings <em>“Tsuge wataru shinonome.</em> / …announce the coming of dawn.”, as this pattern is often used to suggest looking into the distance.</p>

  <p>From this point on, the jiutai, who is now acting as a narrator, announces the coming of dawn and the end of the play.  After <time datetime='01:21:10' title='01:21:10.000'> Resetting his Left Sleeve </time>, the shite initiates his closing segment by opening up the dance space, with a Right Circle that takes him back to center stage <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares">Square 9</a>. Then,  after having Taken seven steps to Square 3, where he performs a Righgt SStep Pivot, thus facing the <em>tsukurimono</em>, he performs a Forward Point with an Open-retreat, as if identifying his final destination.</p>

  <p>After having Taken eight steps to Square 8, he enters the <em>tsukurimono</em> as the <time datetime='01:22:36' title='01:22:36.000'> <em>nohkan</em> </time> that had not been heard yet, announces the imminent end of the play with its closing <a href="/music/nohkan/Tomenote"><em>Tome</em></a> pattern. At about the same time, the shite moves his Fan to Left Hand in preparation for a <time datetime='01:22:53.000' title='01:22:53'>Pillow Fan</time>, a pattern that suggests disappearance, that he performs as the jiutai sings <em>“sono mama yume to zo nari ni keru. </em>/ …becoming one with the dream.”. </p>
