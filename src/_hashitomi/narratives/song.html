      The song is an example of Noh becoming a stage for the thoughts of the protagonists and a melting of distinctions between them. The poetic text sung by the woman refers to an offering of flowers to Buddha, thus alludes to the memorial service for flowers performed by the monk.
      One could speculate that her apparition voices the thoughts of the monk. Thus, the two characters have now become one despite their physical distance – the woman remaining on the bridge while the monk is sitting at the waki’s post (Square 5).
      The veiled dreamy quality of the scene is emphasized by the shite's slight lowering of the mask, a gesture called <em>kumorasu</em> – ‘cloud the face’,  often performed to suggest a contemplative moment.
