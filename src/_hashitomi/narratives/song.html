      The song is an example of Noh becoming a stage for the thoughts of the protagonists and a melting of distinctions between them. The poetic text sung by the shite refers to an offering of flowers to Buddha, thus alludes to the memorial service for flowers performed by the waki. One can speculate that the woman/flower apparition voices the thoughts or represents the dream of the priest. The two characters have now become one despite their physical distance – the shite remains on the bridge and has yet to enter the main stage while the waki is sitting at the waki’s post (Square 5). The veiled dreamy quality is emphasized by the slight lowering of the face and mask of the shite called kumorasu – ‘cloud the face’, which is often used for contemplative moments.
