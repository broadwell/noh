  <p>Based on a <em>tanka</em> by Sōjō Henjō (816-890), this song is the play’s first chanted poetic text, and as such it raises the Intermedia Index. However, it still remains relatively low because this unaccompanied solo song, is delivered motionless at the First Pine.</p>

  <p>Yet, the song is a beautiful example of Noh becoming a stage for the thoughts of the shite and waki, and a melting of distinctions between them. The poetic text sung by the woman refers to an offering of flowers to Buddha, thus alluding to the memorial service for flowers performed by the monk. One could speculate that her apparition voices the thoughts of the monk. Thus, the two characters have now become one despite their physical distance – the woman remaining on the bridge while the monk is sitting at the waki’s post (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 5</a>). The veiled dreamy quality of the scene is emphasized by the shite's slight lowering of the mask, a gesture called <em>kumorasu</em> – ‘cloud the face’, often performed to suggest a contemplative moment.</p>
