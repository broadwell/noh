Close to the end of the dialogue, the nohkan player joins in with the <em>shimo no takane</em> pattern. It is used exclusively to accompany the dialogue between waki and ai-kyōgen. It also serves as a signal to the actors in backstage that the second act is about to start.</div>

      <p>The ai-kyōgen interlude in Hashitomi has a typically simple intermedia character. The kyōgen actor converses with the waki with very little movement and mostly without music.</p>

       <p>In preparation for the <em>ai-kyōgen</em>, the percussionists fold their chairs, as all of the musicians <time datetime='00:22:45.000' title='00:22:45'>  kneel in a straight line facing sideways </time> to indicate that although they are on stage they are not involved.</p>

      <p>However, half way through the interlude, when the ai-kyōgen turns back to the waki to re-enter into a dialogue, the drummers return to sitting on the chairs. It is the tradition of the Morita school of nohkan playing to layer the final section of the <em>ai-kyōgen</em> with a melodic pattern called <em>shimo no takane</em>. It is a non-congruent melody that includes few patterns that are specific to the <em><time datetime='00:34:37.000' title='00:34:37'> shimo no takane</time></em>, but also others borrowed from <em>mi roku no ge</em>, <em>takane hane</em>, and <em>kuse-no-ryo</em>. The end of the nohkan’s melody must coincide more of less with the end of the dialogue between the kyōgen and the waki. Having memorized the text, the nohkan player positions his patterns accordingly.
