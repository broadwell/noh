      When a play is divided into two acts, the shite exits after the first one to change costumes and prepare for the second act. The time when the actor is off the stage is called <em>nakairi</em>. During this period, an interlude known as <em>aikyōgen</em> is performed on the stage.  Typically, a kyōgen actor impersonating a local resident enters the stage and converses with the waki. In the process, he summarizes the first act and provides some basic information leading into the second one, as it is that case with Hashitomi.
      Less often, both the shite and waki exit. In this case, the entering kyōgen actor delivers a monologue, as it is the case with Kokaji.
      Although less frequent, it is also possible for a kyōgen actor to appear within an act, in which case the <em>aikyōgen</em> is performed by a different actor. Kanawa which opens with the kyōgen is a good example. In this case, the <em>aikyōgen</em> is performed by the wakizure.</p>

      <p>In preparation for the <em>aikyōgen</em>, the percussionists fold their chair, as the musicians <time datetime='00:22:45.000' title='00:22:45'>  sit on a straight line facing sideways </time> to indicate that although they are on stage they are not involved in the action.</p>

      <p>It is the tradition of the Morita school of nohkan playing to layer the final section of the <em>aikyōgen</em> with a melodic pattern called <em>shimo no takane</em>. It is a non-congruent melody that includes few patterns that are specific to the <em><time datetime='00:34:37.000' title='00:34:37'> shimo no takane</time></em>, but also others borrowed from <em>mi roku no ge</em>, <em>takane hane</em>, and <em>kuse-no-ryo</em> . The end of the nohkan’s melody must coincide more of less with the end of the dialogue between the kyōgen and the waki. Having memorized the text, the nohkan player positions his patterns accordingly.
