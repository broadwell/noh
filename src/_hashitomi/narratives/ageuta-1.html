  <p>The first <em>ageuta</em> is the dramatic and intermedia climax not only of the Shite Exits <em>dan</em>, but also of the whole first act. It brings a new and refreshing sound: the jiutai, the last performer who had not yet taken part in the play. The jiutai’s first entrance always delineates an important moment in a play, hence it's special name – <em>shodō</em>. The <em>ageuta</em> is also the first <em>shōdan</em> accompanied by the full hayashi – the two percussion instruments and the nohkan. It produces thus far its richest and most consolidated texture. The <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori" target="_blank"><em>hiranori</em></a> chant and its percussion accompaniment in <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">strict</a> rhythm, brings the first use of poetic text in congruent setting. </p>

  <p>The narrative introduces an important piece of information that helps indentify who could the woman be. In the very first line, it gives the location of a dwelling in Gōjo, which in the <em>Genji monogatari</em> is associated with Lady Yūgao’s home. Being the first line of an <em>ageuta</em>, it is given great emphasis by being delivered twice, separated by the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"><em>uchikiri</em></a>.</p>

  <p>The final passage involves stage movement that is related to the text. While the jiutai sings that “<em><time datetime='00:19:41.000' title='00:19:41'>“In the moment the eyes turn aside, she becomes a dream.”</time></em> the shite takes Six Steps Forward, in preparation for a <time datetime='00:20:10.000' title='00:20:10'>Right Circlet</time>, which he then performs to mimic the woman’s disappearance, as announced by the jiutai: “<em><time datetime='00:20:15.000' title='00:20:15'>“…as she disappears in the shadow of the flowers.”</time></em>”. As the melodic line, supported by the nohkan’s <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"><em>mi roku no ge</em></a> pattern, moves from the high range to medium, preparing to cadence in the low range, the shite performs the standard cllosing pair of movements <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> and <a href="/movement/open-retreat//" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>. The shite can now leave the stage, which will be done slowly and in silence.
