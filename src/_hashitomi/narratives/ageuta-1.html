    <p>The last module of the Dialogue section is the dramatic and intermedia climax of the arch as well as the whole first act. The spirit's identity is further revealed followed by her unexpected disappearance. The music produces thus far its richest and most consolidated texture while mimetic stage movement directly illustrates the text.
      </p>
      <p>
        The music is transformed as the module brings in a new and refreshing sound of the jiutai, the last performer who had not yet taken part in the play. The jiutai’s first entrance always delineates an important moment in a play, hence it's special name – <em>shodō</em>. It is also the first <em>shōdan</em> involving singing with all instrumentalists – the two percussion instruments and the nohkan. The chant being set in <em>hiranori</em>, it is also the first module in the play with congruent singing and strict rhythmic setting of percussion.</p>

        <p>The final passage involves stage movement that is related to the text. While the jiutai sings the module’s third line stating that <time datetime='00:19:41.000' title='00:19:41'>“In the moment the eyes turn aside, she becomes a dream.”</time>, the spirit takes six steps forward, in preparation for a <time datetime='00:20:10.000' title='00:20:10'>Right Circlet</time>, which she then performs to mimic her disappearance, as annonced by the jiutai: <time datetime='00:20:15.000' title='00:20:15'>“…as she disappears in the shadow of the flowers.”</time>. As the melodic line, supported by the nohkan’s <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"><em>mi roku no ge</em></a> pattern,  moves from the high range to medium, preparing to cadence in the low range, the shite performs the standard sequence of movements Forward Pointing and Open-retreat, and exits the stage.
