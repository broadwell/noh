    <p>
      This <em>shōdan</em> has two points of intermedia interest, respectively related to form and dance.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, it brings in a new and refreshing sound since it is sung by the jiutai, the last performer who had not yet taken part in the action. It plays the role of a narrator and provides another hint on the woman’s identity when it refers to <em><time datetime='00:18:54.000' title='00:18:54'> gojō atari </time></em>,  that is the ‘neighborhood of the fifth street’, where according to the <em> Genji Monogatari </em>, Lady Yūgao’s dwelling was temporarily located. Moreover, anticipating the exit of the shite, we hear that the ‘Evening face’ (Lady Yūgao's translated name) is disappearing in the flower’s shadow, referencing the way she first appeared to Genji, as alluded to in the second <em>kakaru</em>.

        <p>It is also the first <em>shōdan</em> involving singing with the two percussion instruments and the nohkan, producing thus far the play’s richest texture. Being set in <em>hiranori</em>, it is also the first module in the play with congruent singing, accompanied by the percussion instruments in strict setting. Hence this is the first <em>shōdan</em> involving a relationship between syllabic setting of the text and the eight-beat measure (<em>honji</em>).</p>

        <p>Finally, this <em>shōdan</em> is the first one to involve stage movements that are related to the text. While the jiutai signs the module’s third line stating that <time datetime='00:19:41.000' title='00:19:41'>“In the moment the eyes turn aside, she becomes a dream.”</time>, Lady Yūgao takes six steps forward, in preparation for a <time datetime='00:20:10.000' title='00:20:10'>Right Circlet</time> that she performs to mimic her disappearance, that the jiutai is about to announce: <time datetime='00:20:15.000' title='00:20:15'>“…as she disappears in the shadow of the flowers.”</time>. As the melodic line, supported by the nohkan’s <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"><em>mi roku no ge</em></a> pattern,  moves from the high range to the medium one, preparing to cadence in the low range, the shite performs the standard sequence of movements Forward Pointing and Open-retreat, and exits the stage.
