    <p>The entrance of the monk is the opening of the play. It starts a typical Waki Enters section. As such, and fitting well with tradition of very gradual build-up in Noh, it is very calm and simple. Before the first arch of raising energy and intermedia richness develops, the movement is slow and predictable, the music is limited to one instrument playing languidly without a beat, the entering actor is a secondary one and there is no text or chant.</p>

    <p>The simple instrumentation of a nohkan solo is also appropriate for the entrance of a modest monk. In the next shōdan he will not reveal his name but only the name of the temple that he is from. The nohkan plays the <em>nanoribue</em> in a plain fashion to underline the relative lightness of the play and modesty of the monk. The monk's <a href="/staging/costumes/#Hashitomi-Waki" target="_blank">unpatterned costume</a> in a single color gives the feeling of subdued and subtle elegance.</p>
    <p>
    It is the nohkan player’s responsibility to loosely adapt the pacing to the waki’s walking speed so that the performance of the entrance music coincides with the waki’s concluding <em>kata</em>: the Step back.</p><p>[In preparation for the <em>ai-kyōgen</em>, the kyōgen would usually enter inconspicuously in the middle of the first act during the first <em>ageuta</em>. In Hashitomi, the first <em>ageuta</em> concludes the act and is followed immediately by the shite’s exit. Thus, the kyōgen enters earlier, inconspicuously together with the waki, not to interfere with the shite's exit.]</p>
