        <div class="section-introduction__definition"><p>The waki solemnly enters the stage and stops at Square 1. He is followed by the aikyōgen who sits down at the back of the bridge opposite Pine 1.</p><p>In preparation for the kyōgen, the aikyōgen would usually enter inconspicuously in the middle of the first act during the first ageuta. In Hashitomi, the first ageuta concludes the act and includes shite’s exit. Not to interfere with this the aikyōgen enters earlier, together with the waki.</p></div>

    <p>As the waki enters the stage, he is accompanied by a nohkan’s solo. The simple instrumentation is appropriate for the entrance of a modest priest who does not reveal his name just that of his temple.  The nohkan plays plainly also to underline the relative lightness of the play. The unpatterned costume in a single color reinforces the feeling of subdued and subtle elegance. It is the nohkan player’s responsibility to adapt their playing to the waki’s walking speed so that the conclusion of the nanoribue coincides with the end of waki’s movement pattern <em>Step back</em>. Usually, entrance music precedes the raising of the curtain, but in Hashitomi the waki calls for the opening of the curtain which starts the nanoribue and then he enters. WHY? </p>
