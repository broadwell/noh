He is followed by the kyōgen who sits down at the back of the bridge opposite Pine 1.</p><p>In preparation for the <em>aikyōgen</em>, the kyōgen would usually enter inconspicuously in the middle of the first act during the first <em>ageuta</em>. In Hashitomi, the first <em>ageuta</em> concludes the act and is followed immediately by the shite’s exit. Thus, the kyōgen enters earlier together with the waki, not to interfere with the shite's exit.</p></div>

    <p>The nohkan solo accompanies the waki as he enters the stage. The simple instrumentation is appropriate for the entrance of a modest priest who does not reveal his name but the name the temple he is from.
    The nohkan plays the <em>nanoribue</em> in a plain fashion to underline the relative lightness of the play. The priest's <a href="/staging /staging/costumes/#Hashitomi-Waki" target="_blank">unpatterned costume</a> in a single color reinforces the feeling of subdued and subtle elegance.
    It is the nohkan player’s responsibility to adapt the playing to the waki’s walking speed so that the performance of the entrance music coincides with the waki’s concluding <em>kata</em>: the Step back.
