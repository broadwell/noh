        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The <a href="/music/voices/#Waki" target="_blank">waki</a> dressed in <a href="/staging/costumes/#Hashitomi-Waki">humble monk clothes</a> enters the stage and stops at <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a>. He is followed by the <a href="/music/voices/#Ai" target="_blank">kyōgen</a> in a <a href="/staging/costumes/#Hashitomi-Ai">local townsman costume</a> who sits down at the back of the bridge opposite Pine 1. The kyōgen would usually enter inconspicuously in the middle of the first act during the first <em>ageuta</em>. In Hashitomi, the first <em>ageuta</em> concludes the act and is followed immediately by the shite’s exit. Thus, the kyōgen enters earlier, inconspicuously together with the waki, not to interfere with the shite's exit.</div>

  <p>The play opens with the entrance of the monk accompanied by a nohkan solo. The nohkan player performs it in a plain fashion that colors the monk with modesty, and suggest a play with a lighter tone. The monk's <a href="/staging/costumes/#Hashitomi-Waki" target="_blank">unpatterned costume</a> in a single color gives a feeling of subdued and subtle elegance.</p>

  <p>The simple instrumentation of this unmetered melody, the absence of text, and the casual and predictable movements provide this <em>shōdan</em> with a low Intermedia Index, a common way of starting the first <em>shōdan</em> of a play’s first <em>dan</em>.</p>

  <p>It is the nohkan player’s responsibility to loosely adapt the pacing to the waki’s walking speed so that the performance of the entrance music coincides with the waki’s concluding <em>kata</em> : the <time datetime='00:05:03.000' title='00:05:03'>Step back</time>.</p>
