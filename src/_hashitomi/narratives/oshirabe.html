<p>Oshirabe is a short musical piece that is heared before a play. The musicians perform it in the anteroom separated from the audience by the curtain. It announces that the performance is about to begin and establishes the expressive character of the play. It offers a transition from often fast-paced everyday life to the contemplative magic of Noh Theater. </p>
    <p>Oshirabe means ‘to tune,’ and it refers to the musicians adjusting their instruments before the show. As such, it is not considered an actual section of a play. The tuning session is needed because each percussion instrument is reassembled right before the performance, and no playing is allowed while in the back of the stage. It is thei musicians' first opportunity to hear and adjust their instruments. They do not attempt to tune to one another's pitch. Rather they are attuning to the play’s <em>kurai</em>, or its overall atmosphere. After finishing, the musicians bow to each other reinforcing their unity as a group.</p>
