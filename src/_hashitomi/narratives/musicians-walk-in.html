    <p>For the musicians to enter, the curtain is pulled back only partially on one side. The full lift-up is reserved for the actors whose arrival is dramatized. The role of the musician is seen as accompanying so they appear with utmost humility. The instrumentatlists walk slowly one at a time through the bridge to their standard position. The jiutai members enter through a small door on stage-left and with same modesty take their sitting positions on the side of the stage. None of these performers ever turn their backs to the audience nor make eye contact with anyone. They must maintain the subordinate role and preserve the <em>kurai</em> introduced during the oshirabe. After their arrival, an assistant to the kotsuzumi player enters through the jiutai door and sits down behind the master.</p>
