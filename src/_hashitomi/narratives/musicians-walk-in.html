    <p>The entrance of the musicians happens in silence. For the instrumentalists, the curtain is pulled back partially on one side. The full lift-up is reserved for the actors whose arrival is dramatized. The musicians' role is seen as accompanying so they appear with humility and poise. They come out one at a time and walk slowly over the bridge to their standard position. The jiutai members enter through a small door on stage-left and with same modesty and decorum take their sitting positions on the side of the stage. The performers avoid turning their backs to the audience or making eye contact. They preserve the <em>kurai</em> introduced during the <em>oshirabe</em>. After their arrival, an assistant to the kotsuzumi player enters through the jiutai door and sits down behind the master.</p>
