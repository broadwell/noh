          <td class="content-table__column">The primary actor and vocal soloist is usually masked. In some plays the shite has a companion actor called the shite-tsure who can also be masked. Although the tsure can also dance, if only one is to dance it will always be the shite. The story revolves around him. At first, we usually know nothing if not very little about his true identity. Often, he is a character from another world, embodying for example a divine being or deceased person. In the latter case, (and considering that most plays are composed of two acts) the first act shite is often a spirit who has taken the form of a person, and the ghost or apparition of the same spirit in the second act. In some plays the shite has one or few companion actors called <strong>Shite Tsure</strong>.</td>

          <td class="content-table__column">In traditional Noh repertoire the secondary actor is a realistic male character living in the narrative's present hence he is never masked. We usually know who he is from the beginning since he typically introduces himself immediately after arriving on stage. He engages the shite and provides him with a reason to re-appear and perform. Plays without a waki are exceptionally few. There are three majors types of waki characters: a shrine official or retainer; a warrior; but most commonly a traveling monk. In some plays the waki has one or few unmasked companion actors called <strong>Wakizure.</td>

          <td class="content-table__column">It is in the early 17th century that the chorus called jiutai became a permanent stage member. Originally, the shite and waki sung in unison what constitutes today's jiutai's part. The members of the group are not masked. Today's standard membership varies between 6 and 10 performers. For selected academic examples we have used a two-person jiutai. The role of the jiutai is to keep the story going, setting the scene, describing the characters and actions.  It does not have an identity of its own within the story. Singing in unison only, it can either be a narrator or ‘speak’ for the shite or waki. Its first singing moment in a play called <em>shodō</em>, always marks an important point in the development of a play. The members of the jiutai are always from the same school as the shite.</td>

          <td class="content-table__column">Often perceived as ‘assistant’, the kōken is in fact an important non-performing actor. The shite’s kōken is typically his senior and always from the same school. His active function is to oversee all stage activity, help with on stage changing of costume when necessary, prompting in a normal voice if the shite forgets a line and handling props as required. He also has the responsibility to take over should the shite be unable to complete the performance. Sitting in the back stage-right, the kōken provides the shite with an important anchoring presence on stage.</td>

          <td class="content-table__column">Most plays are composed of two acts. The first one is usually concluded by the exit of the mae-shite (first act shite). During the time he changes costume to transform into the nochi-shite (second act shite) an ai-kyōgen performs the interlude between two acts. Usually not masked and a realistic character, he often provides a summary of the first act and context for the second by engaging in a discussion with the waki if the latter has remained on stage. When the ai-kyōgen plays the role of a diety it can be masked as it is the case in Kokaji. </td>
