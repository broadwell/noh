    <p>In progress - commenting on the general character of the play with attention to its intermedia particularity,how does it fit in the context of Noh repertoire.</p>
  <p>The figure below the video summarizes the form of Kokaji. Each of the play's twenty sections is represented with a
    column whose width is proportional to its duration. The Y axis displays the twenty-nine levels of energy as defined
    in the
    <a href="/about-intermedia#intermedia-tools" target="_blank">
      Introduction to the Intermedia Structure
    </a> .

    Clicking on a column will move the video to the beginning of that section and update information in the table
    beside the figure, showing the section's name (shōdan) and status of its components. The section’s name in the
    table is linked to a page with its analysis.

  </p>
  <p>The figure shows that the overall duration of the first act is about twice the duration of the second, which
    creates a sense of acceleration of the form as a whole. It shows also that the transformation of the play's media
    components is not linear, but rather comes in waves. The overall roller coaster shape of the figure counts four
    peaks, with the first one being the lowest and the third one the highest.</p>

    <div>
      <p>After having had a dream about a powerful sword, the 11th century emperor Ichijō sends an envoy to the swordsmith
        Kokaji Munechika requesting that he forges that sword. Munechika, who does not have an assistant with the proper
        skills to help him create that sword, goes to the Inari shrine to pray. There a boy comes to him and tells him that
        help is coming. Munechika goes back home where the deity from the Inari shrine appears and helps him forge the
        requested sword.</p>

  <h2>Act I</h2>
  <h3>Waki’s enters</h3>
  <p>The waki's entrance part is spread over three modules (<em>shōdan</em>), the first two are non-congruent, while the third and last one is congruent.<br>
  It is the <time datetime='00:03:00.000' title='00:03:00'>wakizure</time> who first enters the stage without any accompaniment. Upon reaching Square 1, he delivers an unaccompanied spoken <time datetime='00:03:55.000' title='00:03:55'>monologue </time> (<a href="/kokaji/nanori/" target="_blank"><em>nanori's</em></a> analysis).<br>
  Then, a <time datetime='00:05:15.000' title='00:05:15'>dialogue</time> between the wakizure and waki (<a href="/kokaji/mondo-1/" target="_blank"><em>mondō-1</em></a>) precedes a congruent <time datetime='00:08:43.000' title='00:08:43'>chant</time>.<br>
  Set in <em>hiranori</em>, it is accompanied by the two hand-percussion in strict setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. This type of <em>shōdan</em> called an <em>ageuta</em> is often used to close the Waki- and Shite-enters sections of a play (<a href="/kokaji/ageuta-1/" target="_blank"><em>ageuta-1</em></a>).</p>

  <h3>Shite’s enters</h3>
  <p>In most Noh plays, the arrival on stage of the principal actor – the shite, is announced with an entrance music. In Kokaji the shite enters section is unusual as the arrival of the shite – a boy appearing out of thin air, is meant to be unexpected. Thus, to assure the surprise effect there is no entrance music, rather it starts with a two-part introduction:  a short spoken <time datetime='00:10:46.000' title='00:10:46'>exchange</time> between the wakizure and the waki (<a href="/kokaji/dialogue/" target="_blank"><em>dialogue</em></a>), followed by a spoken <time datetime='00:11:00.000' title='00:11:00'>soliloquy</time> delivered by the waki (<a href="/kokaji/monologue/" target="_blank"><em>monologue</em></a>).<br>
  This leads to the shite’s entrance which comes as an unexpected<time datetime='00:12:18.000' title='00:12:18'> call from the distance </time>, called <em>yobikake</em> .</p>

  <h3>Dialogue</h3>
  <p>The Dialogue section is spread over two <em>shōdan</em>. The <em>yubikake</em> merges with a <time datetime='00:12:53.000' title='00:12:53'>dialogue</time> in prose between the shite and waki (<a href="/kokaji/mondo-2/" target="_blank"><em>mondō-2</em></a>).<br>
  It is followed by the second congruent <time datetime='00:14:58.000' title='00:14:58'>chant</time> of the play, another <em>ageuta</em>. Set in <em>hiranori</em>, it is delivered by the jiutai, accompanied by the two-hand percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan's part (<a href="/kokaji/ageuta-2/" target="_blank"><em>ageuta-2</em></a>). </p>


  <h3>The Shite performs</h3>
  <p>The first act’s Shite performs section is composed of three <em>shōdan</em>. It starts with a dynamic non-congruent <time datetime='00:16:54.000' title='00:16:54'>chant </time> sung by the jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part (<a href="/kokaji/kuri/" target="_blank"><em>kuri</em></a>).<br>
  The overall level of congruency is lowered with the next module, a recitative-like <time datetime='00:17:55.000' title='00:17:55'>chant </time> sung by the shite and jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in flexible rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part (<a href="/kokaji/sashi/" target="_blank"><em>sashi</em></a>).<br>
  The <time datetime='00:19:53.000' title='00:19:53'>dance-to-text</time> <em>shōdan</em> that follows substantially raises the play's overall level of congruency. This is where the plot kernel is given and as such it is the first act’s point of focus. Sung by the shite and jiutai, it is set in <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by the percussion instruments set in strict rhythm and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. It is divided up into two parts. The shite is kneeling center-stage for the first one, but dances during the last one (<a href="/kokaji/kuse/" target="_blank"><em>kuse</em></a>).</p>

  <h3>Shite exits</h3>
  <p>The Shite exits section counts three <em>shōdan</em>.  It opens with a <time datetime='00:29:07.000' title='00:29:07'>dialogue</time> in prose  between the shite and waki whose last line is sung rather than spoken (<a href="/kokaji/kakeai-1/" target="_blank"><em>kakeai-1</em></a>).<br>
  It is followed by the first act’s third <em>ageuta</em>, a congruent <time datetime='00:30:05.000' title='00:30:05'>chant</time> set in <em>hiranori</em> performed by the jiutai and accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan's part (<a href="/kokaji/ageuta-3/" target="_blank"><em>ageuta-3</em></a>).<br>
  The first act is then concluded with an <time datetime='00:31:20.000' title='00:31:20'>exit music</time> that accompanies the shite and waki’s exit, as well as the kyogen actor’s entrance. It is performed by the three percussionists and the nohkan player. The rhythmic setting is flexible during the exit of the two protagonists, but becomes strict for the entrance of the kyōgen (<a href="/kokaji/raijo/" target="_blank"><em>raijo</em></a>). </p>

  <h2>Interlude</h2>
  <p>The <em><time datetime='00:34:49.000' title='00:34:49'>nakairi</time></em> or short performance between the acts, traditionally performed by a kyōgen actor, has a dual function: first, it allows time for the shite to change mask and costume to transform into the second-act character; second, it helps clarify the story. The kyōgen is usually unmasked and engaged in a discussion with the waki, but the situation is different in Kokaji. First the kyōgen is masked since he personifies a deity from a lower-ranked shrine. Moreover, he addresses the audience since the waki has left the stage for a change of costume.</p>

<section id="act2" title="Act II" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <h2>Act II</h2>
  <h3>Waki waits</h3>
  <p>
    The second act opens up with the waki performing a <em>notto</em>, a non-congruent <time datetime='00:45:19.000' title='00:45:19'>chant</time>,
    sung by the waki in <em>sashinori</em> style, accompanied by a steady percussion beat (<a href="/kokaji/notto/" target="_blank"><em>notto's</em></a> analysis).<br>
    It is followed by a congruent <time datetime='00:48:41.000' title='00:48:41'>chant</time>, set in <em>ōnori</em> accompanied by a percussion part set in strict rhythm. It is introduced by the waki but sang by the jiutai (<a href="/kokaji/noriji-1/" target="_blank"><em>noriji-1</em></a>).</p>

  <h3>Shite re-enters</h3>
  <p>The Shite re-enters section includes only one <em>shōdan</em>, an extremely dynamic <time datetime='00:51:07.000' title='00:51:07'> entrance music </time>, with the two-hand percussion instruments and taiko in strict rhythmic setting and the very first congruent nohkan part in the play (<a href="/kokaji/hayafue/" target="_blank"><em>hayafue</em></a>).</p>

    <h3>Dialogue</h3>
    <p>There is no Dialogue section in Kokaji’s second act.</p>

  <h3>Shite performs</h3>
  <p> The second act’s Shite performs includes three <em>shōdan</em>. The second one is the <time datetime='00:53:16.000' title='00:53:16'> instrumental dance </time>, thus the highlight of the play (<a href="/kokaji/maibataraki/" target="_blank"><em>maibataraki</em></a>).<br>
  It is flanked on each side by the <time datetime='00:52:31.000' title='00:52:31'> second </time>, and <time datetime='00:54:15.000' title='00:54:15'> third </time> congruent chants set in <em>ōnori</em>.<br>
  Accompanied by the percussion set in strict rhythm, the first one also includes a non-congruent nohkan part (<a href="/kokaji/noriji-2/" target="_blank"><em>noriji-2</em></a>).<br>
  The jiutai who sings the first one is joined by the shite in the second one (<a href="/kokaji/noriji-3/" target="_blank"><em>noriji-3</em></a>).</p>

  <h3>Shite exits</h3>
  <p>
    The second act’s Shite exits section includes two <em>shōdan</em>. It starts with a short spoken <time datetime='00:56:10.000' title='00:56:10'>dialogue </time> between the waki and shite, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic setting (<a href="/kokaji/kakeai-2/" target="_blank"><em>kakeai-2</em></a>).<br>
    It is followed by the second and last <time datetime='00:56:40.000' title='00:56:40s'>dance-to-text</time> module.  Sung by the jiutai and shite, it is set in <em>chūnori</em> with a percussion part in strict rhythm and a non-congruent nohkan part (<a href="/kokaji/kiri/" target="_blank"><em>kiri</em></a>).</p>
