  <p>The blocks below the video summarizes <a href="/form/#Kokaji/" target="_blank">Kokaji’s form</a>. The colors show that Act I and II are composed resepectively of five and four sections (<em>dan</em>), and that each section is composed of a numbers of modules (<em>shōdan</em>) that ranges between one and three.
  Each module (<em>shōdan</em>) is represented with a block whose width is proportional to its duration, and whose height displays its Intermedia Texture Index as defined in the <a href="/about-intermedia#intermedia-tools" target="_blank">Introduction to the Intermedia Structure</a>. Clicking on a block moves the video to the beginning of that <em>shōdan</em> and update the information in the table on the side of the figure, showing the <em>shōdan’s</em> name and status of its components. The <em>shōdan’s</em> name in the table is linked to its intermedia analysis.</p>

  <p>The figure shows that the overall duration of the first act is about twice the duration of the second, which creates a sense of acceleration at the form level. The raising height of the blocks within each section suggests that the transformation of the play's media components is not linear, but that it rather comes in waves. We identified three waves: the wave within each section, starting with a <em>shōdan</em> with low Intermedia Index that incrementally moves to <em>shōdan</em> with higher Index; the wave of the sections' highest peaks within an act, also shows in both a gradual increase in the Intermedia Index towards their second to last section, concluded with a section that has slighlty lower Index; the wave of the sections' highest peaks throughout the play, shows a build-up towards the fourth section of the Act I, followed by a decline in the Index that is rapidly regained after the beginning of Act II, where it steadily raises until the instrumental dance.

    <h3 class="collapsible collapsible-closed">Synopsis</h3>
    <div>
      <p>After having had a dream about a powerful sword, the 11th century emperor Ichijō sends an envoy to the swordsmith
        Kokaji Munechika requesting that he forges that sword. Munechika, who does not have an assistant with the proper
        skills to help him create that sword, goes to the Inari shrine to pray. There a boy comes to him and tells him that
        help is coming. Munechika goes back home where the deity from the Inari shrine appears and helps him forge the
        requested sword.</p>

  <h2>Act I</h2>
  <h3>Waki’s enters</h3>
  <p>The waki's entrance part is spread over four modules (<em>shōdan</em>), the first two are non-congruent, while the third and last one is congruent. It is the wakizure who first enters the stage <time datetime='00:03:00.000' title='00:03:00'>without any accompaniment</time>. Upon reaching Square 1, he delivers an unaccompanied spoken <time datetime='00:03:55.000' title='00:03:55'>monologue </time>.Then, a <time datetime='00:05:15.000' title='00:05:15'>dialogue</time> between the wakizure and waki precedes a congruent <time datetime='00:08:43.000' title='00:08:43'>chant</time>.<br>
  Set in <em>hiranori</em>, it is accompanied by the two hand-percussion in strict setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. This type of <em>shōdan</em> called an <em>ageuta</em> is often used to close the Waki- and Shite-enters sections of a play. The momentum is reduced as the Waki Enters section is concluded with a short spoken <time datetime='00:10:46.000' title='00:10:46'>exchange</time> between the wakizure and the waki.

  </p>

  <h3>Shite’s enters</h3>
  <p>In most Noh plays, the arrival on stage of the principal actor – the shite, is announced with an entrance music. In Kokaji the shite enters section is unusual as the arrival of the shite – a boy appearing out of thin air, is meant to be unexpected. Thus, to create a surprise effect there is no entrance music, rather the shite is introduced with a spoken <time datetime='00:11:00.000' title='00:11:00'>soliloquy</time> delivered by the waki. This will lead to the actual shite’s entrance which will come as an unexpected <time datetime='00:12:18.000' title='00:12:18'> call from the distance </time>. Titled <em>yobikake</em>, it is merged with the <em>Mondō-2</em> that opens the next section. </p>

  </p>

  <h3>Dialogue</h3>
  <p>The Dialogue section is spread over two <em>shōdan</em>. The <em>yubikake</em> merges with a <time datetime='00:12:53.000' title='00:12:53'>dialogue</time> in prose between the shite and waki. It is followed by the second congruent <time datetime='00:14:58.000' title='00:14:58'>chant</time> of the play, another <em>ageuta</em>. Set in <em>hiranori</em>, it is delivered by the jiutai, accompanied by the two-hand percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan's part. </p>

  <h3>The Shite performs</h3>
  <p>The first act’s Shite performs section is composed of three <em>shōdan</em>. It starts with a dynamic non-congruent <time datetime='00:16:54.000' title='00:16:54'>chant </time> sung by the jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part.
  The overall level of congruency is lowered with the next module, a recitative-like <time datetime='00:17:55.000' title='00:17:55'>chant </time> sung by the shite and jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in flexible rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part.  The <time datetime='00:19:53.000' title='00:19:53'>dance-to-text</time> <em>shōdan</em> that follows substantially raises the play's overall level of congruency. This is where the plot kernel is given and as such it is the first act’s point of focus. Sung by the shite and jiutai, it is set in <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by the percussion instruments set in strict rhythm and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. It is divided up into two parts. The shite is kneeling center-stage for the first one, but dances during the last one.</p>

  </p>

  <h3>Shite exits</h3>
  <p>The Shite exits section counts three <em>shōdan</em>.  It opens with a <time datetime='00:29:07.000' title='00:29:07'>dialogue</time> in prose  between the shite and waki whose last line is sung rather than spoken. It is followed by the first act’s third <em>ageuta</em>, a congruent <time datetime='00:30:05.000' title='00:30:05'>chant</time> set in <em>hiranori</em> performed by the jiutai and accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan's part.The first act is then concluded with an <time datetime='00:31:20.000' title='00:31:20'>exit music</time> that accompanies the shite and waki’s exit, as well as the kyōgen actor’s entrance. It is performed by the three percussionists and the nohkan player. The rhythmic setting is flexible during the exit of the two protagonists, but becomes strict for the entrance of the kyōgen. </p>

  <h2>Interlude</h2>
  <p>The <em><time datetime='00:34:49.000' title='00:34:49'>nakairi</time></em> or short performance between the acts, traditionally performed by a kyōgen actor, has a dual function: first, it allows time for the shite to change mask and costume to transform into the second-act character; second, it helps clarify the story. The kyōgen is usually unmasked and engaged in a discussion with the waki, but the situation is different in Kokaji. First the kyōgen is masked since he personifies a deity from a lower-ranked shrine. Moreover, he addresses the audience since the waki has left the stage for a change of costume.</p>

  <h3>Waki waits</h3>
  <p>
    The second act opens up with the waki performing a <em>notto</em>, a non-congruent <time datetime='00:45:19.000' title='00:45:19'>chant</time>,
    sung by the waki in <em>sashinori</em> style, accompanied by a steady percussion beat.It is followed by a congruent <time datetime='00:48:41.000' title='00:48:41'>chant</time>, set in <em>ōnori</em> accompanied by a percussion part set in strict rhythm. It is introduced by the waki but sang by the jiutai.</p>

    <h3>Dialogue</h3>
    <p>There is no Dialogue section in Kokaji’s second act.</p>

  <h3>Shite performs</h3>
  <p> The second act’s Shite performs includes three <em>shōdan</em>. The second one is the <time datetime='00:53:16.000' title='00:53:16'> instrumental dance </time>, thus the highlight of the play.It is flanked on each side by the play's <time datetime='00:52:31.000' title='00:52:31'> second </time>, and <time datetime='00:54:15.000' title='00:54:15'> third </time> congruent chants set in <em>ōnori</em>. Accompanied by the percussion set in strict rhythm, the first one also includes a non-congruent nohkan part.
  The jiutai who sings the first one is joined by the shite in the second one.</p>

It is followed by the second and last <time datetime='00:56:40.000' title='00:56:40s'>dance-to-text</time> module.
