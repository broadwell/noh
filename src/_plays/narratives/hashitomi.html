  <h2 class="collapsible">Introduction</h2>
  <p>The blocks below the video summarizes <a href="/form/#Hashitomi/" target="_blank">Hashitomi’s form</a>. The colors show that Act I and II are composed resepectively of four and five sections (<em>dan</em>), and that each section is composed of a numbers of modules (<em>shōdan</em>) that ranges between one and three.
  Each module (<em>shōdan</em>) is represented with a block whose width is proportional to its duration, and whose height displays its Intermedia Texture Index as defined in the <a href="/about-intermedia#intermedia-tools" target="_blank">Introduction to the Intermedia Structure</a>. Clicking on a block moves the video to the beginning of that <em>shōdan</em> and update the information in the table on the side of the figure, showing the <em>shōdan’s</em> name and status of its components. The <em>shōdan’s</em> name in the table is linked to its intermedia analysis.</p>

  <p>The figure shows that the overall duration of the first act is about half the duration of the second, suggesting a short introduction of the play’s main argument, followed by a slowly unfolding story. The raising height of the blocks within each section suggests that the transformation of the play's media components is not linear, but that it rather comes in waves. We identified three waves: the wave within each section, starting with a <em>shōdan</em> with a low Intermedia Index that incrementally moves to <em>shōdan</em> with higher Index; the wave of the sections' highest peaks within an Act, also shows a gradual increase in the Intermedia Index throughout the Act I. The Index in Act II peaks with the instrumental dance before cadencing with a <em>shōdan</em> that has a slighlty lower Index; the wave of the sections' highest peaks throughout the play, shows a build-up towards the end of Act I, rapidly regained after the beginning of the Act II, where it steadily raises until the instrumental dance.

    <p>First act: A monk who is performing a ritual for flowers notices a white one among his lot, and wonders about its kind. A woman who appears to be lending her voice to the flower identifies it as a <em>yūgao</em>, an ‘evening flower’ . </p>
    <p>Second Act: It tells the story Lady Yūgao’s short affair with Prince Genji, as she reminisces about their first encounter. On his way to visit his mistress Lady Rokujō, Genji noticed an unfamiliar white flower on the fence. As he stopped to admire it, he noticed a beautiful lady in the house behind the fence. He sent her a white flower resting on a fan, which came back with an inviting poem written on it, to which Genji replied with a poetic invitation of his own that led to their passionate yet short affair. </p>

  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11">Act I</h2>
  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">Waki enters</h3>
  <p>Composed of three modules (<em>shōdan</em>), the function of this section (<em>dan</em>) is to set up the play’s premise and provide a reason for the shite to appear. As it is usually the case, this task is assigned to the secondary actor, the waki.</p>
  <p>As expected, the <em>dan’s</em> overall Intermedia Index is low, as it remains non-congruent throughout the expansion of its textures. Yet, the index’s progression over its three <em>shōdan</em> displays a gradual increase, which suggest a slight rise in the complexity of some of its intermedia components. The resulting increase in momentum also helps prepare the stage for the upcoming shite’s entrance.</p>

  <p>The <em>dan</em> opens up with an unmetered <time datetime='00:03:38.000' title='00:03:38'> entrance music </time> played by the nohkan. It accompanies the waki as he walks towards the stage. The melody’s free flowing and calm tone creates a serene ambiance well fitting for the entrance of a Buddhist monk.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching Square 1, one of stage’s most resting position, the waki delivers an unaccompanied <time datetime='00:05:25.000' title='00:05:25'> monologue </time> with factual information.</p>

  <p>The <em>dan</em>  is concluded with a <em>shōdan</em>  that mixes <time datetime='00:07:02.000' title='00:07:02'> spoken and chanted text </time>. It also marks the entry point for the two percussion instruments.</p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="6,7">Shite enters</h3>
  <p>The Shite enters <em>dan’s</em> function is to introduce the shite, the primary actor who concludes his entrance at the First Pine, delaying his entrance onto the stage-proper to another <em>dan</em>. Composed of two <em>shōdan</em>,  one less than the preceding Waki enters <em>dan</em>, it remains non-congruent throughout its thinning texture. </p>

  <p>The <em>dan’s</em> overall Intermedia Index is low since we are still in the character-introduction phase of the play. Like the preceding <em>dan</em>, it also opens with a non-congruent <time datetime='00:08:56.000' title='00:08:56'> entrance music </time> music, but this one is performed by the nohkan accompanied by the two percussion instruments compared with preceding one for solo nohkan. This is in fact, the first module involving the full <em>hayashi</em>.</p>

  <p>While the entrance music of the Waki enters <em>dan</em> led to the spoken <em>nanori</em>, this one leads to an unmetered unaccompanied <em>sashinori</em> <time datetime='00:13:02.000' title='00:13:02'>chant</time>.</p>

  <p> Compared with the Waki enters <em>dan</em>, this one does not conclude with an increased momentum <em>shōdan</em>,  thus smoothly transitioning to the next <em>dan</em>, the dialogue.</p>

  </p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="8">Dialogue</h3>
  <p>The Dialogue section is composed of only one shōdan. Its function is to set the play’s premise, which is introduced in the exchange between the two protagonists. It is usually at this point that the waki’s curiosity about the shite’s identity is piqued. </p>

  <p>This <em>shōdan</em> <time datetime='00:14:02.000' title='00:14:02'> marks a return </time> to <em>kotoba</em>, signifying that the <em>dan</em> remains within the factual phase of the play, hence its low Intermedia Index. Yet the overall texture has expanded. Compared with the preceding <em>shōdan</em> in <em>kotoba</em>, the <em>nanori</em> which was a monologue, this one is a dialogue which also involves some chanting.</p>

  <p>The <em>dan’s</em> is  also dramatically significant, since it marks the moment the shite not only enters the stage-proper, but finally establishes visual contact with the waki. Another interesting aspect about its dramatic potential is reflected in the play’s energetic level as shown by the blocks.  The <em>dan</em> appears to be working in tandem with the next one: the Shite exits. Indeed, the Intermedia Index shows an energetic curve starting with the Dialogue that climaxes with the <em>ageuta 1</em>, the high point of Act I.</p>

<section id="interlude" title="interlude" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="12,13">Interlude</h2>
  <p>The short performance between the acts is often referred to as an <time datetime='00:23:17.000' title='00:23:17'>interlude</time> since the development of the narrative is temporarily put on hiatus. Traditionally performed by an unmasked kyōgen actor, the interlude has a dual function: First, it allows time for the shite to change mask and costume to transform into the second-act character; Second, it helps clarify the story.  For instance, the kyōgen actor acting as a well-informed villager as he engages with the waki he summarizes the first act before providing context for the second one. </p>

<section id="act2" title="Act II" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22">Act II</h2>
  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="14">Waki waits</h3>

  <p>The function of the Waki waits <em>dan</em> is to restart the narrative and provide a reason for the shite to re-enters. Hashitomi’s Waki waits <em>dan</em> is composed of a single <em>shōdan</em>. Based on a factual text switching to poetic at its conclusion, it is a non-congruent <em>sashinori</em> <time datetime='00:39:23.000' title='00:39:23'>chant</time> for one voice, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic setting. </p>
  <p>The play’s premise being already set, the Intermedia Index at the beginning of Act II is higher than it was at the beginning of Act I. Yet, the return to factual text and non-congruency, combined with the smaller instrumentation and the lack of movement keeps it in the lower range. This being said, there is an important difference is the transformation of the Intermedia Index in Act II compared with Act I. In the first act, the Intermedia Index of each <em>dan</em> forms a wave leading to a peak, where the sequence of highest peaks creates another wave that leads to the highest peak of Act I in the last <em>dan</em>. In the second act, there is a single wave, as the Intermedia Index of subsequent <em>dan</em>keeps increasing until the instrumental dance in the Shite performs <em>dan</em>, which is followed by a small release in the following <em>dan</em>.</p>

  <p> Intermedia analysis: <a href="/hashitomi/kakaru-3/" target="_blank"><em>Kakaru 3</em></a></p>

<h3 data-highlight-shodans="15,16,17">Shite re-enters</h3>
<p>The Shite re-enters <em>dan’s</em> function is to introduce the second act shite. The Kongō school’s <em>utaibon</em> describes the first act shite as a woman, the second act one as the woman’s spirit, the difference between the two made visible by the change of <a href="/staging/costumes/#Hashitomi-Shite1" target="_blank">costume</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>dan</em> is composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, and marks the first definitive move towards congruency, thus initiating the ascending curve of the Intermedia Index that will peak with the instrumental dance.
Although the first <em>shōdan</em> in the sequence is still non-congruent, it expands the overall texture with an <em>einori</em> <time datetime='00:40:56.000' title='00:40:56'>chant</time> for one voice and jiutai, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. It is followed by two congruent chants, both set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments now in strict rhythmic setting. The <time datetime='00:44:42.000' title='00:44:42'>first</time> one is sung by the shite, the  <time datetime='00:45:40.000' title='00:45:40'>second</time> one by the jiutai. </p>
<p>The rapid development of the <em>dan’s</em> musical texture is counterbalanced with the absence of any dance movements. Yet, it showcases two dramatic moments. The first one relates to the shite’s entrance, who delivers the <em>issei</em>-chant from inside the <em>tsukurimono</em>. The idea of ‘being heard but not seen had already been seeded with his entrance in the first act. The next moment comes at the end of the <em>ageuta</em> when the drape around the <em>tsukurimono</em> is slowly removed, revealing the woman’s visual identity. </p>

</p>

<h3 data-highlight-shodans="18">Dialogue</h3>

<p>While the function of the Act I Dialogue <em>dan</em> was to set the play’s premise, the function of the Act II Dialogue <em>dan</em> is to provide the shite with a reason to dance. </p>
<p>It includes only one <em>shōdan</em>, a congruent <time datetime='00:47:15.000' title='00:47:15'>sung dialogue</time> between the shite and jiutai. Its poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by the full <em>hayashi</em> with the percussion in strict setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part, continues to push upward the Intermedia Index. Although  the performance of movements is rather limited since the shite remains seated for almost the entire <em>rongi</em>, it is in this <em>shōdan</em>, that he will come out of from behind the <em>hashitomi</em>.</p>

<p> Intermedia analysis: <a href="/hashitomi/rongi/" target="_blank"><em>Rongi</em></a>.</p>


<h3 data-highlight-shodans="19,20">Shite performs</h3>

<p>The Intermedia Index climaxes in the second act Shite performs <em>dan></em>. It is composed of two <em>shōdan</em>, each one a highlight in its own right. It starts with the first <time datetime='00:51:58.000' title='00:51:58'> dance-to-text </time> <em>shōdan</em>  of the play. Its poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> , illustrated with various mimetic <em>kata</em>, is accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan part. </p>

<p>The next <em>shōdan</em> is the congruent <time datetime='01:01:31.000' title='01:01:31'> instrumental dance </time>, where the two-hand percussion instruments maintain their strict rhythmic setting paired with a congruent nohkan’s part for the first and last time in the play. Following a <em>shōdan</em> that put text and dance in counterpoint, this one opens the floor to the poetical beauty of dance. </p>

<h3 data-highlight-shodans="21,22">Shite exits</h3>

<p>The final Shite exits <em>dan</em> introduces a sequence of two <em>shōdan</em>. The first one marks a momentary step back in the play’s congruency level with a non-congruent <time datetime='01:17:26.000' title='01:17:26'>chant</time>, delivered by the shite standing on Square 9. Accompanied by the two hand-percussion set in strict rhythm, the absence of the nohkan who carried the <em>jonomai’s</em> melody is noticeable as it produces a reduction in the instrumental density.  In spite of the narrative’s return, this <em>shōdan</em> marks a sudden though short drop of the Intermedia Index.
Sitting between two congruent and danced <em>shōdan</em>, one could argue that its function is to precisely offer a step away from congruency and dancing, thus providing a fresh beginning to the  <time datetime='01:18:15.000' title='01:18:15'>dance-to-text</time> <em>shōdan</em> that follows. Set in <em>ōnori</em>, the poetic text of the last <em>shōdan</em> is sung by the jiutai and shite. The dance is accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. The <em>shōdan’s</em> concludes the play with the second highest Intermedia Index. </p>
