  <h2 class="collapsible">Introduction</h2>
  <p>The blocks below the video summarizes <a href="/form/#Hashitomi/" target="_blank">Hashitomi’s form</a>. The colors show that Act I and II are composed resepectively of four and five sections (<em>dan</em>), and that each section is composed of a numbers of modules (<em>shōdan</em>) that ranges between one and three.
  Each module (<em>shōdan</em>) is represented with a block whose width is proportional to its duration, and whose height displays its Intermedia Texture Index as defined in the <a href="/about-intermedia#intermedia-tools" target="_blank">Introduction to the Intermedia Structure</a>. Clicking on a block moves the video to the beginning of that <em>shōdan</em> and update the information in the table on the side of the figure, showing the <em>shōdan’s</em> name and status of its components. The <em>shōdan’s</em> name in the table is linked to its intermedia analysis.</p>

  <p>The figure shows that the overall duration of the first act is about half the duration of the second, suggesting a short introduction of the play’s main argument, followed by a slowly unfolding story. The raising height of the blocks within each section suggests that the transformation of the play's media components is not linear, but that it rather comes in waves. We identified three waves: the wave within each section, starting with a <em>shōdan</em> with a low Intermedia Index that incrementally moves to <em>shōdan</em> with higher Index; the wave of the sections' highest peaks within an Act, also shows a gradual increase in the Intermedia Index throughout the Act I. The Index in Act II peaks with the instrumental dance before cadencing with a <em>shōdan</em> that has a slighlty lower Index; the wave of the sections' highest peaks throughout the play, shows a build-up towards the end of Act I, rapidly regained after the beginning of the Act II, where it steadily raises until the instrumental dance.

  <div>
    <p><p>First act: A monk who is performing a ritual for flowers notices a white one among his lot, and wonders about its kind. A woman who appears to be lending her voice to the flower identifies it as a <em>yūgao</em>, an ‘evening flower’ . </p>
    <p>Second Act: It tells the story Lady Yūgao’s short affair with Prince Genji, as she reminisces about their first encounter. On his way to visit his mistress Lady Rokujō, Genji noticed an unfamiliar white flower on the fence. As he stopped to admire it, he noticed a beautiful lady in the house behind the fence. He sent her a white flower resting on a fan, which came back with an inviting poem written on it, to which Genji replied with a poetic invitation of his own that led to their passionate yet short affair. </p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="10,11">Shite exits</h3>
  <p>The Shite exits section is composed of a single <em>shōdan</em>, the play’s <em>shodo</em> since it corresponds to the first entry of the jiutai, who sings the first and sole <time datetime='00:18:53.000' title='00:18:53'> congruent chant </time> of the first act. Its poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> is accompanied by the two-hand percussion in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. This dramatic expansion of the texture concludes the first act, as the shite leaves the stage without any musical accompaniment.</p>

  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="12,13">Interlude</h2>
  <p>The short performance between the acts is often referred to as an <time datetime='00:23:17.000' title='00:23:17'>interlude</time> since the development of the narrative is temporarily put on hiatus. Traditionally performed by an unmasked kyōgen actor, the interlude has a dual function: First, it allows time for the shite to change mask and costume to transform into the second-act character; Second, it helps clarify the story.  For instance, the kyōgen actor acting as a well-informed villager as he engages with the waki he summarizes the first act before providing context for the second one. </p>

<p>The Shite re-enters section is composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, and marks the first definitive move towards congruency.

It is followed by two congruent chants, both set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments now in strict rhythmic setting . The first <time datetime='00:44:42.000' title='00:44:42'> one </time> is sung by the shite, while the <time datetime='00:45:40.000' title='00:45:40'> second </time> one, is sung by the jiutai.</p>

Its poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> is accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan part. The next <em>shōdan</em> is the congruent <time datetime='01:01:31.000' title='01:01:31'> instrumental dance</time>, where the two-hand percussion instruments maintain their strict rhythmic setting paired with a congruent nohkan’s part for the first and last time in the play.
