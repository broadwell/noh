  <h2 class="collapsible">Introduction</h2>
  <p>In progress - commenting on the general character of the play with attention to its intermedia particularity,how does it fit in the context of Noh repertoire and other '3rd category' plays.</p>

  <p>The figure below the video summarizes the form of Hashitomi. Each of the play's module (<em>shōdan</em>) is represented with a column whose width is proportional to its duration. The Y axis displays the Intermedia Texture Index as defined in the <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/noh/intermedia-structure.html">Introduction to the Intermedia Structure</a> . Clicking on a column will move the video to the beginning of that <em>shōdan</em> and update the information in the table on the side of the figure, showing the <em>shōdan’s</em> name and status of its components. The <em>shōdan’s</em> name in the table is linked to its analysis.</p>

  <p>The figure shows that the overall duration of the first act is about half the duration of the second, suggesting a slow unfolding of the story after a short introduction of the play’s main argument. The spread high peaks suggest that the transformation of the play's media components is not linear, but that it rather comes in waves.</p>

  <h2>Act I</h2>
  <h3>Waki enters</h3>
  <p>The waki's entrance section is spread over three modules (<em>shōdan</em>). It remains non-congruent throughout the expansion of its texture, as it moves from a non-congruent <time datetime='00:03:38.000' title='00:03:38'> entrance music </time> played by the nohkan, to an unaccompanied <time datetime='00:05:25.000' title='00:05:25'> spoken voice </time> delivering factual information, before concluding with a non-congruent  <time datetime='00:07:02.000' title='00:07:02'> <em>sashinori</em> chant </time> for one voice, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic setting.</p>

  <h3>Shite enters</h3>
  <p>The shite’s entrance section is spread over two <em>shōdan</em>. It remains non-congruent throughout the reduction of its texture, as it moves from an <time datetime='00:08:56.000' title='00:08:56'> entrance music </time> with a non-congruent nohkan’s part accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic setting to an unaccompanied  <time datetime='00:13:02.000' title='00:13:02'> <em>sashinori</em> chant </time>.</p>

  <h3>Dialogue</h3>
  <p>The dialogue section is spread over two <em>shōdan</em>. It starts with an unaccompanied <time datetime='00:14:02.000' title='00:14:02'> spoken dialogue </time>, before moving to a non-congruent <time datetime='00:17:29.000' title='00:17:29'> <em>sashinori</em> chant </time> for two voices, accompanied by the two-hand percussion in flexible rhythmic setting.</p>
  <p>Shite performs</p>

  <p><h3>There is no Shite performs section in Hashitomi’s first act.</h3></p>

  <h3>Shite exits</h3>

  <p>The Shite exits section is composed of a single <em>shōdan</em>, the play’s <em>shodo</em> since it corresponds to the first entry of the jiutai, who sings the first and sole <time datetime='00:18:53.000' title='00:18:53'> congruent chant </time> of the first act. Its poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> is accompanied by the two-hand percussion in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. This dramatic expansion of the texture concludes the first act, as the shite leaves the stage without any musical accompaniment.</p>

  <h2>Interlude</h2>
  <p>
    The short performance between the acts is often referred to as an <time datetime='00:23:17.000' title='00:23:17'> <em>interlude</em> </time> since the development of the narrative is temporarily put on hiatus. Traditionally performed by an unmasked kyōgen actor, the interlude has a dual function: First, it allows time for the shite to change mask and costume to transform into the second-act character; Second, it helps clarify the story, since the kyōgen actor, engaged in a discussion with the waki,  summarizes the first act before providing context for the second one.

<section id="act2" title="Act II" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <h2>Act II</h2>
  <h3>Waki waits</h3>

<p>The Waki waits section is composed of a single <em>shōdan</em>, a non-congruent  <time datetime='00:23:17.000' title='00:23:17'> <em>sashinori</em> chant </time> for one voice, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic setting.</p>

<h3>Shite re-enters</h3>
<p>The Shite re-enters section is composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, and marks the first definitive move towards congruency. Although the first <em>shōdan</em> in the sequence is still non-congruent, it expands the overall texture with an <time datetime='00:40:56.000' title='00:40:56'> <em>einori</em> chant </time> for one voice and jiutai, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments now in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. The entrance <em>issei</em>-music leading to the <em>issei</em>-chant is unusually short since the shite is already on stage, hidden by the <em>tsukurimono</em>.
It is followed by two congruent chants, both set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments now in strict rhythmic setting . The first <time datetime='00:44:42.000' title='00:44:42'> one </time> is sung by the shite, while the <time datetime='00:45:40.000' title='00:45:40'> second </time> one, is sung by the jiutai.</p>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>

<p>The second act dialogue section includes only one <em>shōdan</em>, a congruent <time datetime='00:47:15.000' title='00:47:15'> sung dialogue</time> between the shite and jiutai. The poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> is accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan part.</p>


<h3>Shite performs</h3>

<p> The second act Shite performs section is substantial with two <em>shōdan</em>, each one a highlight in its own right. It starts with the first <time datetime='00:51:58.000' title='00:51:58'>dance-to-text</time> <em>shōdan</em > of the play. Its poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> is accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan part.
The next <em>shōdan</em> is the congruent <time datetime='01:01:31.000' title='01:01:31'> instrumental dance</time>, where the two-had percussion instruments maintain their strict rhythmic setting paired with a congruent nohkan’s part for the first and last time in the play.


<h3>Shite exits</h3>

<p>The Shite exits section introduces a sequence of two <em>shōdan</em>. The overall transformation towards congruency takes <time datetime='01:17:26.000' title='01:17:26'> step back </time> with a return to a non-congruent chant, accompanied by the two hand-percussion set in strict rhythm.
It is followed by the plays’ second <time datetime='01:18:15.000' title='01:18:15'> dance-to-text </time> <em>shōdan</em>. Its poetic text set in <em>ōnori</em> is sung by the jiutai and shite. It is accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkans’ part.</p>
