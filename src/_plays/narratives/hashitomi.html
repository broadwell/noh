  <h3 class="collapsible collapsible-closed">Intermedia Form</h3>

  <div>
  <p>The <a href="/about-intermedia/#intermedia-tools" target="_blank">blocks</a> below the video summarize <a href="/form/#Hashitomi" target="_blank">Hashitomi’s form</a> as represented by Intermedia Index values. Blocks that are grouped by color, show that Act I and II are composed respectively of four and five sections (<em>dan</em>), and that each one is composed of modules (<em>shōdan</em>) that number in the range between one and three.</p>

  <p> The overall duration of the first act is about half the duration of the second.  As such, the first act functions as a relatively brief introduction to the play’s substantial second act.</p>

  <p>The fluctuating height of the blocks demonstrates that the transformation of the play's Intermedia Index is not linear, but that it rather comes in  waves. The graph illustrates three scales of transformation: the rising wave within each <em>dan</em>; the rising wave across either act; and the rising wave of the play as a whole. </p>

  <p>There is an important difference in the way the Intermedia Index of each act transforms. In the first act, the Intermedia Index of each <em>dan</em>  forms a wave leading to a peak on the <em>dan’s</em> last <em>shōdan</em>. This is followed by a drop in the Index of the following <em>dan’s</em> first <em>shōdan</em>. There is an exception only in the Index of the single-<em>shōdan</em> Dialogue <em>dan</em>, which starts a wave that is carried through the following <em>dan</em>, the Shite Exits. Thus, the first act counts three waves. The first two correspond to the entrance of the Waki and Shite, respectively. The third one corresponds to the setting of the play’s premise. On the other hand, there is only one wave in the second act, as the Intermedia Index of subsequent <em>dan</em>  keeps increasing until the instrumental dance in the Shite performs <em>dan</em>, which is followed by a small release in the last <em>dan</em>, Shite Exits. </p>

  <p>While the Intermedia Index is naturally at its lowest at the beginning of Act I, its three highest peaks create a wave that culminates on the third. The play’s premise being already set, the Intermedia Index at the beginning of Act II is higher than it was at the beginning of Act I. In fact, all of the <em>shōdan</em> in the first act except for the highest one, remain below most of the second act's with the exception of the introductory one.  The highest Index of the first act is a true peak as it is only in the third <em>dan</em> of the second act that we regain its level and continue the build-up.</p>

  <div>
    <p>First act: A monk who is performing a ritual for flowers notices with bewilderment a white one that appears to smile. He asks about its name. A woman who lends her voice to the flower identifies it as a <em>yūgao</em>, an ‘evening flower’. </p>
    <p>Interlude: A local villager in a conversation with the monk tells the story of Lady Yūgao. We learn that passing through Gojō on his way to visit his mistress Lady Rokujō, Prince Genji noticed with admiration the abundunt yūgao flowers growing on a dwelling. He asked his retainer Koremitsu to pluck some. The blossoms came on a scented fan with a poem written on it. Genji replied with his own, which led to a romantic affair. It was shortlived as Lady Yūgao became possessed by a vengeful spirit.</p>
    <p>Second Act: The monk visits the house of Lady Yūgao in Gojō. Her spirit appears and reminesces on her first night with Genji and their introduction through yūgao flowers and the exchange of poems written on the fan. </p>

  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11">Act I</h2>
  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">Waki Enters</h3>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">Composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>dan</em> sets up the scene for the main character to appear. As it is usually the case, this task is assigned to the secondary actor, the waki.</p>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">As expected, the <em>dan’s</em> overall Intermedia Index is low. It remains non-congruent throughout the expansion of its textures. Yet, the index’s progression over its three <em>shōdan</em> displays a gradual increase in intermedia complexity. The resulting rise of momentum helps prepare the stage for the upcoming entrance of the shite.</p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">The <em>dan</em> opens with <em>Nanoribue</em>, an unmetered <time datetime='00:03:38.000' title='00:03:38'> entrance music </time> played by the nohkan alone. It accompanies the waki as he walks towards the stage. The melody’s free-flowing and calm tone creates a serene ambiance well fitting for the entrance of a Buddhist monk.</p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">Upon reaching Square 1, one of stage’s most restful positions, the waki delivers the <em>Nanori</em>, an unaccompanied <time datetime='00:05:25.000' title='00:05:25'> monologue </time>, introducing himself in prose.</p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">The <em>dan</em>  is concluded by <em>Kakaru 1</em>, a <em>shōdan</em> with a richest texture so far. It mixes <time datetime='00:07:02.000' title='00:07:02'> spoken and chanted text </time>, brings in the two percussion instruments for the first time and positions the waki in the center of the stage. Mimetic elements of prayer and sutra chanting add interest.</p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="6,7">Shite Enters</h3>
  <p  data-highlight-shodans="6,7">The <em>dan’s</em> function is to introduce the protagonist. The shite interrupts the entrance at the First Pine though, saving his entrance onto the stage-proper for a later <em>dan</em>. Composed of only two <em>shōdan</em>, it remains non-congruent throughout. </p>

  <p  data-highlight-shodans="6,7">The <em>dan’s</em> overall Intermedia Index is low since we are still in the character-introduction phase of the play. Like the preceding <em>dan</em>, it opens with a non-congruent <time datetime='00:08:56.000' title='00:08:56'> entrance music </time>, the <em>Ashirai</em>. This time it is performed by the nohkan accompanied by the two percussion instruments. This is the first module involving the full <em>hayashi</em>.</p>

  <p  data-highlight-shodans="6,7">While the waki introduced himself in spoken prose, the shite uses poetry  as he performs the Song in unmetered <em>sashinori</em> <time datetime='00:13:02.000' title='00:13:02'>chant</time>. This raises the Intermedia Index in preparation for the next <em>dan</em>, the dialogue.</p>

  </p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="8">Dialogue</h3>
  <p>The Dialogue section consists of only one <em>shōdan</em>. Its function is to set the play’s premise through an exchange between the two actors. As it is often the case it is in this dan that the waki’s curiosity about the shite’s identity is piqued. </p>

  <p>The overall Intermedia Index stays low. The <em>shōdan</em> returns <time datetime='00:14:02.000' title='00:14:02'> to spoken prose </time> but includes also some chanting in unmetered <em>sashinori</em> and engages both shite and waki.</p>

  <p>The <em>dan</em> is also significant dramatically. The shite not only enters the stage-proper, but also establishes contact with the waki. </p>

  <p>Formally, the <em>dan</em> appears to be a preparation for the next one: the Shite Exits. The Intermedia Index shows an energetic curve starting with the Dialogue that climaxes with the <em>Ageuta 1</em>, in the Shite Exits <em>dan</em>.</p>

  </p>

  <h3>Shite Performs</h3>
  <p>There is no Shite Performs section in Hashitomi’s first act. The <em>shōdan</em> that traditionally defines this <em>dan</em> – the <em>Kuse</em> – is included in the second act.</p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="9,10,11">Shite Exits</h3>
  <p>The <em>dan</em> concludes the setting of the play's premise and introduces the basis for narrative continuation in Act II before seeing the shite leave the stage. The Intermedia Index slope shows that it carries on the momentum initiated with the preceding one before reaching the highest peak of Act I. It then leads to a dramatic drop to a silent and slow exit. </p>

  <p>The <em>dan</em> consists of two <em>shōdan</em>. As a pair, they could be compared to the <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/rongi" target="_blank"><em>rongi</em></a>, a <em>shōdan</em> commonly used to close Act I. They follow the same structure: the first part is a <time datetime='00:17:29.000' title='00:17:29'> Dialogue</time> partially spoken, partially sung in non-congruent setting, followed by a <time datetime='00:18:53.000' title='00:18:52'>poetic</time> and congruent chant, here, an <em>Ageuta</em>.</p>

  <p>The first <em>shōdan</em> is flows freely as a non-congruent chant with text in prose, accompanied by the percussion instruments in flexible setting. It is delivered as the two protagonists remain essentially motionless in their respective positions. The <em>shōdan</em> concludes with a clue about the shite’s identity. It refers to a mansion whose location is then identified at the very beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>. This important moment in the dramatic unfolding of the play is underlined by the introduction of the first congruent chant in the play and the first entrance of the jiutai. Moreover, in preparation for his exit, and for the first time in the play, the shite performs a sequence of dance <em>kata></em>.</p>

<section id="interlude" title="interlude" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="12,13">Interlude</h2>
  <p>Fitting with its typical function and form, the <em>kyōgen</em><time datetime='00:23:17.000' title='00:23:17'>Interlude</time> in Hashitomi sees an un-masked kyōgen actor acting as a well-informed villager engaging in a dialogue with the monk. For most of the <em>shōdan</em> they kneel on the floor and remain almost motionless. We hear a 'plain-spoken' story of Lady Yūgao, which provides the viewers with essential narrative background for the understanding of the main character in the play.</p>

<section id="act2" title="Act II" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22">Act II</h2>
  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="14">Waki Waits</h3>

  <p>The Waki Waits <em>dan</em> restarts the narration and sets the ground for the shite to re-enter. In Hashitomi, the <em>dan</em> is composed just of  one <em>shōdan</em>. A mostly descriptive prose switches to poetry only at its conclusion. It is a non-congruent <em>sashinori</em> <time datetime='00:39:23.000' title='00:39:23'>chant</time> for one voice, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic setting. Adding to it a lack of movement, the overal Intermedia Index stays in the lower range. </p>

    <a href="/hashitomi/kakaru-3/" target="_blank"><em>Kakaru 3</em></a></p>

<h3 data-highlight-shodans="15,16,17">Shite Re-enters</h3>
<p>The function of the shite re-enters <em>dan</em> is to re-introduce the shite, now, in their new guise. The Kongō school’s <em>utaibon</em> describes the first act shite as a woman, the second act one as the woman’s spirit, the difference between the two made visible by the change of <a href="/staging/costumes/#Hashitomi-Shite1" target="_blank">costume</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>dan</em> is composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, and brings the first definitive move towards congruency, thus initiating the ascending curve of the Intermedia Index that will peak with the instrumental dance.
Although the first <em>shōdan</em> in the sequence is still non-congruent, it expands the overall texture with an <em>einori</em> <time datetime='00:40:56.000' title='00:40:56'>chant</time> for one voice and jiutai, accompanied by a non-congruent nohkan’s part and the two hand-percussion instruments already in strict rhythmic setting. It is followed by two congruent chants, both set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments still in strict rhythmic setting. The <time datetime='00:44:42.000' title='00:44:42'>first</time> one is sung by the shite, the  <time datetime='00:45:40.000' title='00:45:40'>second</time> one by the jiutai. </p>

<p>The rapid development of the <em>dan’s</em> musical texture is counterbalanced by the absence of any dance movements. Yet, the staging increases the visual impact in two steps.  Firstly, the shite’s entrance is in voice only. The actor 'appears' by delivering the <em>issei</em>-chant from inside the <em>tsukurimono</em>. This creates great mystery and builds anticipation. Being first heard but not seen is also a beautiful echo of the shite's similar entrance in the first act. Second, at the end of the <em>ageuta</em>, only when the drape around the <em>tsukurimono</em> is slowly removed, the spirit's visual identity is finally revealed. </p>

<h3 data-highlight-shodans="18">Dialogue</h3>

<p>While the Dialogue <em>dan</em> in Act I was setting the play’s premise, this <em>dan</em> serves an introduction to the climax of the play. It creates a context and reason for the shite to dance. </p>

<p>The <em>dan</em> consists of only one <em>shōdan</em>, the  <em>rongi</em>. It is a congruent <time datetime='00:47:15.000' title='00:47:15'>sung dialogue</time> performed by the shite and the jiutai. Its poetic text is set in <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by the full <em>hayashi</em> with the percussion in strict setting, and a non-congruent nohkan. Set for two voices instead of one, as in the preceding two chants, this <em>shōdan</em> continues to push upward the Intermedia Index. Although  the performance of <em>kata</em> is rather limited – the shite remains seated for almost the entire time – it is in this <em>shōdan</em>, that the shite walks out from behind the lattice, the <em>hashitomi</em> and asserts new presence on the stage.</p>

<h3 data-highlight-shodans="19,20">Shite Performs</h3>

<p>The play's Intermedia Index climaxes in this <em>dan</em>. It is composed of two <em>shōdan</em>, each one a highlight in its own right. It starts with the <em>Kuse</em>, the first <time datetime='00:51:58.000' title='00:51:58'> dance-to-text </time> <em>shōdan</em>  of the play. Its poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> is illustrated with various mimetic <em>kata</em>. It is accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan part. </p>

<p>The next <em>shōdan</em> is a congruent <time datetime='01:01:31.000' title='01:01:31'> instrumental dance </time>, where the two-hand percussion instruments maintain their strict rhythmic setting and, for the first and only time in the play, we hear a congruent nohkan part. Following a <em>shōdan</em> that directly correlated text and mimetic dance, this one features pure dance in its full poetical beauty. </p>

<h3 data-highlight-shodans="21,22">Shite Exits</h3>

<p>The final <em>dan</em> consists of two <em>shōdan</em>. The first, the <em>Waka</em>, is a momentary respite before the final <em>Kiri</em>, which concludes the play with the second highest Intermedia Index. </p>

<p>The absence of dance and nohkan, both of which for the previous 15 minutes carried the <em>jonomai</em>, is noticeable. The singing drops back to non-congruent <time datetime='01:17:26.000' title='01:17:26'>chant</time> but text is poetic and delivered by the shite standing in the central Square 9 with accompaniment of the two hand-percussion in strict rhythm. Sufficient tension is maintained to lead smoothly to the final climax.</p>

<p>The <em>Kiri</em> brings back movement as <time datetime='01:18:15.000' title='01:18:15'>dance-to-text</time> that uses powerful central square and front of the stage. The poetic text is sung by the jiutai and the shite accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting. In the final moments, the nohkan returns with a closing pattern. The intermedia spectacle ends at full force and then dissolves when during dramatically slowing music the audience sees the shite disappear behind the <em>hashitomi</em>.</p>
