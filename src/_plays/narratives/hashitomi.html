  <h2 class="collapsible">Introduction</h2>
  <p>The blocks below the video summarizes <a href="/form/#Hashitomi/" target="_blank">Hashitomi’s form</a>. The colors show that Act I and II are composed resepectively of four and five sections (<em>dan</em>), and that each section is composed of a numbers of modules (<em>shōdan</em>) that ranges between one and three.
  Each module (<em>shōdan</em>) is represented with a block whose width is proportional to its duration, and whose height displays its Intermedia Texture Index as defined in the <a href="/about-intermedia#intermedia-tools" target="_blank">Introduction to the Intermedia Structure</a>. Clicking on a block moves the video to the beginning of that <em>shōdan</em> and update the information in the table on the side of the figure, showing the <em>shōdan’s</em> name and status of its components. The <em>shōdan’s</em> name in the table is linked to its intermedia analysis.</p>

  <p>The figure shows that the overall duration of the first act is about half the duration of the second, suggesting a short introduction of the play’s main argument, followed by a slowly unfolding story. The raising height of the blocks within each section suggests that the transformation of the play's media components is not linear, but that it rather comes in waves. We identified three waves: the wave within each section, starting with a <em>shōdan</em> with a low Intermedia Index that incrementally moves to <em>shōdan</em> with higher Index; the wave of the sections' highest peaks within an Act, also shows a gradual increase in the Intermedia Index throughout the Act I. The Index in Act II peaks with the instrumental dance before cadencing with a <em>shōdan</em> that has a slighlty lower Index; the wave of the sections' highest peaks throughout the play, shows a build-up towards the end of Act I, rapidly regained after the beginning of the Act II, where it steadily raises until the instrumental dance.

  <div>
    <p>First act: A monk who is performing a ritual for flowers notices a white one among his lot, and wonders about its kind. A woman who appears to be lending her voice to the flower identifies it as a <em>yūgao</em>, an ‘evening flower’ . </p>
    <p>Second Act: It tells the story Lady Yūgao’s short affair with Prince Genji, as she reminisces about their first encounter. On his way to visit his mistress Lady Rokujō, Genji noticed an unfamiliar white flower on the fence. As he stopped to admire it, he noticed a beautiful lady in the house behind the fence. He sent her a white flower resting on a fan, which came back with an inviting poem written on it, to which Genji replied with a poetic invitation of his own that led to their passionate yet short affair. </p>

  <h2>Act I</h2>
  <h3>Waki enters</h3>
  <p>Composed of three modules (<em>shōdan</em>), the function of this section (<em>dan</em>) is to set up the play’s premise and provide a reason for the shite to appear. As it is usually the case, this task is assigned to the secondary actor, the waki.</p>
  <p>As expected, the <em>dan’s</em> overall Intermedia Index is low, as it remains non-congruent throughout the expansion of its textures. Yet, the index’s progression over its three <em>shōdan</em> displays a gradual increase, which suggest a slight rise in the complexity of some of its intermedia components. The resulting increase in momentum also helps prepare the stage for the upcoming shite’s entrance.</p>

  <p>The <em>dan</em> opens up with an unmetered <time datetime='00:03:38.000' title='00:03:38'> entrance music </time> played by the nohkan. It accompanies the waki as he walks towards the stage. The melody’s free flowing and calm tone creates a serene ambiance well fitting for the entrance of a Buddhist monk.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching Square 1, one of stage’s most resting position, the waki delivers an unaccompanied <time datetime='00:05:25.000' title='00:05:25'> monologue </time> with factual information.</p>

  <p>The <em>dan</em>  is concluded with a <em>shōdan</em>  that mixes <time datetime='00:07:02.000' title='00:07:02'> spoken and chanted text </time>. It also marks the entry point for the two percussion instruments.</p>

  <h3>Shite enters</h3>
  <p>The Shite enters <em>dan’s</em> function is to introduce the shite, the primary actor who concludes his entrance at the First Pine, delaying his entrance onto the stage-proper to another <em>dan</em>. Composed of two <em>shōdan</em>,  one less than the preceding Waki enters <em>dan</em>, it remains non-congruent throughout its thinning texture. </p>

  <p>The <em>dan’s</em> overall Intermedia Index is low since we are still in the character-introduction phase of the play. Like the preceding <em>dan</em>, it also opens with a non-congruent <time datetime='00:08:56.000' title='00:08:56'> entrance music </time> music, but this one is performed by the nohkan accompanied by the two percussion instruments compared with preceding one for solo nohkan. This is in fact, the first module involving the full <em>hayashi</em>.</p>

  <p>While the entrance music of the Waki enters <em>dan</em> led to the spoken <em>nanori</em>, this one leads to an unmetered unaccompanied <em>sashinori</em> <time datetime='00:13:02.000' title='00:13:02'>chant</time>.</p>

  <p> Compared with the Waki enters <em>dan</em>, this one does not conclude with an increased momentum <em>shōdan</em>,  thus smoothly transitioning to the next <em>dan</em>, the dialogue.</p>

  </p>

  <h3>Dialogue</h3>
  <p>The Dialogue section is composed of only one shōdan. Its function is to set the play’s premise, which is introduced in the exchange between the two protagonists. It is usually at this point that the waki’s curiosity about the shite’s identity is piqued. </p>

  <p>This <em>shōdan</em> <time datetime='00:14:02.000' title='00:14:02'> marks a return </time> to <em>kotoba</em>, signifying that the <em>dan</em> remains within the factual phase of the play, hence its low Intermedia Index. Yet the overall texture has expanded. Compared with the preceding <em>shōdan</em> in <em>kotoba</em>, the <em>nanori</em> which was a monologue, this one is a dialogue which also involves some chanting.</p>

  <p>The <em>dan’s</em> is  also dramatically significant, since it marks the moment the shite not only enters the stage-proper, but finally establishes visual contact with the waki. Another interesting aspect about its dramatic potential is reflected in the play’s energetic level as shown by the blocks.  The <em>dan</em> appears to be working in tandem with the next one: the Shite exits. Indeed, the Intermedia Index shows an energetic curve starting with the Dialogue that climaxes with the <em>ageuta 1</em>, the high point of Act I.</p>

  <h2>Interlude</h2>
  <p>The short performance between the acts is often referred to as an <time datetime='00:23:17.000' title='00:23:17'>interlude</time> since the development of the narrative is temporarily put on hiatus. Traditionally performed by an unmasked kyōgen actor, the interlude has a dual function: First, it allows time for the shite to change mask and costume to transform into the second-act character; Second, it helps clarify the story.  For instance, the kyōgen actor acting as a well-informed villager as he engages with the waki he summarizes the first act before providing context for the second one. </p>

  <h2>Act II</h2>
  <h3>Waki waits</h3>

<p>The Waki waits section is composed of a single <em>shōdan</em>, a non-congruent <em>sashinori</em> <time datetime='00:39:23.000' title='00:39:23'>chant</time> for one voice, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic setting .</p>

<h3>Shite re-enters</h3>
<p>The Shite re-enters section is composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, and marks the first definitive move towards congruency. Although the first <em>shōdan</em> in the sequence is still non-congruent, it expands the overall texture with an <em>einori</em> <time datetime='00:40:56.000' title='00:40:56'>chant</time> for one voice and jiutai, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments  in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan’s part.
It is followed by two congruent chants, both set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments now in strict rhythmic setting . The first <time datetime='00:44:42.000' title='00:44:42'> one </time> is sung by the shite, while the <time datetime='00:45:40.000' title='00:45:40'> second </time> one, is sung by the jiutai.</p>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>

<p>The second act Dialogue section includes only one <em>shōdan</em>, a congruent <time datetime='00:47:15.000' title='00:47:15'> sung dialogue</time> between the shite and jiutai. The poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> is accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan part.</p>

<h3>Shite performs</h3>

<p> The second act Shite performs section is substantial with two <em>shōdan</em>, each one a highlight in its own right. It starts with the first <time datetime='00:51:58.000' title='00:51:58'>dance-to-text</time> <em>shōdan</em > of the play. Its poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> is accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan part. The next <em>shōdan</em> is the congruent <time datetime='01:01:31.000' title='01:01:31'> instrumental dance</time>, where the two-hand percussion instruments maintain their strict rhythmic setting paired with a congruent nohkan’s part for the first and last time in the play.

<h3>Shite exits</h3>

<p>The Shite exits section introduces a sequence of two <em>shōdan</em>. The overall transformation towards congruency takes a step back with a return to a non-congruent <time datetime='01:17:26.000' title='01:17:26'>chant</time>, accompanied by the two hand-percussion set in strict rhythm ).
It is followed by the plays’ second <time datetime='01:18:15.000' title='01:18:15'> dance-to-text </time> <em>shōdan</em>. Its poetic text set in <em>ōnori</em> is sung by the jiutai and shite. It is accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkans’ part.</p>
