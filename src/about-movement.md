          <p>Despite its apparent minimalism the movement in Noh is vital, sophisticated and performed with greatest
            precision. It serves structural, easthetic and narrative functions. It co-creates <em>kurai</em>, the
            overarching essential expressive quality of the play.</p>

          <p>It's structural role consists of guiding viewers through the form of the plays by using predictable devices
            and stage positions. For example, one can expect that the play will start with the waki entering and walking
            to Square 1 to present his introduction, and then, continuing to a standard waki position at Square 5. Or,
            during the instrumental dance, the viewers can recognize among others the prescribed progression of sections
            that are differentiated by the fan being first closed, then open, then held above the head. The large scale
            organization of stage movement creates a familiar frame. Sometimes, it provides a basis for poingnant
            expressive exceptions.</p>

          <p>On the smaller scale of time, Noh abounds in abstract movement patterns that are equally familiar to the
            viewers. Using them in different roles allows actors to add unique aesthetic beauty and depth to performed
            characters by imbuing the movement with subtle expressive qualities. The abstract nature of the patterns in
            the instrumental dance in particular allows for evocation and profound contemplation of the spirit in its
            timeless essence.</p>

          <p>When movement is done in direct reference to narrative it is often very sparse. It uses mimetic motives
            that symbolize rather than literally depict. As such it calls on the imagination of the viewer and by doing
            so it deepens their engagement with the play, its narrative and the protagonist.</p>

          <h3 id="Kata">Kata</h3>
          <p>The movements of actors in Noh are choreographed using an extensive vocabulary of basic patterns called
            <em>kata</em>. The patterns can be classified into two categories: formal and mimetic. They are sequenced to
            create more extended stage motions and dances. Our classification and English translation of <em>kata</em>
            names are based on the work of Monica Bethe and Karen Brazell. (<em>Dance in the Noh Theater</em>, Volumes
            1, 2, and 3 published by Cornell University under the Cornell East Asia Series, number 29.) The core
            elements of all noh movement are the basic posture (<a href="/movement/standing/"
              target="_blank"><em>kamae</em></a>) that serves as the start and end of all movement and a sliding walk
            (<a href="/movement/forward/" target="_blank"><em>hakobi</em></a>) that provides the essential flow. </p>

          <h4 id="Formal">Formal kata</h4>
          <p>Ubiquitous and essential, they can appear at any time in the play and anywhere on the stage. Some are
            performed only at specific times and places serving as markers that help create structure. They can involve
            wholistic coordination between feet and arms. Some have variants performed with either closed or open fan.
            They recur throughout the play but are predominant early on and during instrumental dances (<em>mai</em>).
          </p>

          <h4 id="Mimetic">Mimetic kata</h4>
          <p>They serve to add depth to the narrative rather than establish structure. Commonly used mimetically to
            illustrate meaning of sung text, they are often focused on one body part with a unique stipulation ex. if
            the fan is closed or open. They become more frequent as the play progresses and are normally found in such
            narrative shōdan as <em>kuse</em> and <em>kiri</em>.</p>

          <h3 id="Modes">Modes of Movement</h3>
          <p>Zeami (c.1363 - c.1443) in his theoretical work has defined three basic modes of movement:<br>
            Aged Mode (<em>rōtai</em>): embodiment of tradition and the divine.<br>
            Feminine Mode (<em>nyotai</em>): suggesting sensitivity to beauty and emotion.<br>
            Martial Mode (<em>guntai</em>): representing supernatural, demonic quality as well as assertive masculinity.
          </p>

          <p>Yet, the modes are not strictly associated with gender or even specific characters. For instance, in the
            same play a deceased soldier dances in the feminine mode over melodic and lyrical chanting, but switches to
            the martial mode when depicting the battle that led to his death.</p>
          <p>
            Most generally <em>kata</em> performed in feminine mode are characterized by a close position of the feet,
            round gesture, slower tempo and a fluid rhythm, whereas <em>kata</em> performed in martial mode have feet
            positioned further apart, more angular motion, faster tempo and sudden rhythms. For sake of comparison,
            several <em>kata</em> included in the Catalog of Kata are presented both in feminine and martial modes. </p>


          <h3 id="Dances">Dances</h3>
          <p>All movement in Noh is highly formalized and due to its unique aesthetic bares resemblance to dance. In Noh
            tradition though, there is a special term for dance <em>mai</em> that refers to the central shōdan,
            typically in the second half of the play, where the movement of the shite is formal and the accompaniment is
            purely instrumental. These are considered the highlights of the plays. In some plays, all of the performance
            until then may be seen as the preparation for this special expressive climax when words cease and we get to
            contemplate the protagonist's nature, essential emotion or state of mind expressed through dance and music
            only.</p>

          <p>There are two kinds of <em>mai</em>: <em>mai</em> proper and <em>hataraki</em>. Both share a basic
            structure. They typically start upstage, move forward, then to the stage-right corner and after circling one
            or more times return to where they started. Depending on the character of the protagonist either can be slow
            or fast, the gestures could be more sharp or fluid, and the relationship to the beat strict or flexible. The
            difference between the two is mostly in the longer duration and larger number of subsections in <em>mai</em>
            than in <em>hataraki</em>. The former is normally more of a stand-alone scene, while the latter, functions
            as a brief underlining of the moment's mood, emotional coloring or dramatic action. <em>Hataraki</em> can be
            composed of passages that enact a narrative in the play's present like exorcisms or fight scenes.
            <em>Jonomai</em> from Hashitomi is an example of <em>mai</em>, while <em>maibataraki</em>, represents a
            <em>hataraki</em></p>
          <H3 id="Shimai">Shimai and Maibayashi</H3>
          <p>Besides dance in the context of a Noh play, there are two other forms of dance. Dance-to-text
            <em>shōdan</em>, such as <em>kuse</em> and <em>kiri</em>, can be performed independently from a play. This
            form of dance called <em>shimai</em> includes a jiutai usually composed of four members, but no
            <em>hayashi</em>.<br>
            Instrumental dances can also be performed independently from a play. This form of dance called
            <em>maibayashi</em> includes a <em>hayashi</em> and a jiutai with a membership that can vary between three
            and eight singers.</p>

          <p>When performing a <em>shimai</em> or <em>maibayashi</em>, the dancer is not masked and wears a
            crest-adorned <em>kimono</em> and <em>hakama</em> rather than a costume. Moreover, the fan is larger than
            the one used in a play, and it is handled differently by the members of the jiutai. Whereas they kneel with
            hands in their pockets, fans resting on the stage floor when inactive, they hold the fan upwards when
            singing in a play, but hold it resting on their laps when singing in a <em>shimai</em> or
            <em>maibayashi</em>.</p>
