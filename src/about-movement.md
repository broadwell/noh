    <p>The movements of all characters in Noh are choreographed using an extensive vocabulary of basic patterns called kata. Plays use the same kata as modules to build complex stage motion and dances. The sequencing of kata also forms a unified system. Many formal similarities are found between analogous sections of different plays. A large but not exhaustive collection of these kata can be found on this website. Featured KONGŌ Tatsunori and consequently all examples are from the Kongō school.</p>
    <p>Kata patterns can be classified into two categories: structural and mimetic. Our classification and English translation of kata names is entirely based on the monumental work of Monica Bethe and Karen Brazell. (Dance in the No Theater, Volumes 1, 2, and 3 published by Cornell University under the Cornell East Asia Series number 29.)</p>
