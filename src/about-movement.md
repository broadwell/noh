    <h2 class="collapsible collapsible-closed">Dance Patterns and Modes</h2>

  <p>The movements of all characters in Noh are choreographed using an extensive vocabulary of basic patterns called <em>kata</em> that can be classified into two categories: formal and mimetic. (Our classification and English translation of <em>kata’s</em> names is based on the monumental work of Monica Bethe and Karen Brazell: <em>Dance in the Noh Theater</em>, Volumes 1, 2, and 3 published by Cornell University under the Cornell East Asia Series, number 29.)</p>

<h4>Formal kata</h4>
<p>They are ubiquitous and essential. Many can appear anytime and anywhere on the stage. Some are performed only at specific times and places serving as markers that help create structure. They involve coordination between foot and arm, and can be performed with either a closed or open fan. They recur throughout the play but are predominant early on, being abstract they abound during instrumental dances.</p>

<h4>Mimetic kata</h4>
<p>They serve to decorate the structure not to establish it. Often centered on one body part only, they stipulate if the fan is closed or open. Commonly used mimetically to illustrate meaning of sung text, they become more frequent as the play progresses.</p>

<p>Zeami (c.1363 - c.1443) in his theoretical work has defined three basic modes of dance:<br>
Aged Mode (<em>rōtai</em>): embodiment of tradition and the divine.<br>
Feminine Mode (<em>nyotai</em>): suggesting sensitivity to beauty and emotion.<br>
Martial Mode (<em>guntai</em>): representing supernatural, demonic quality as well as assertive masculinity.</p>

<p>Yet, the modes are not strictly associated with gender or even specific characters. For instance, in the same play a deceased soldier dances in the feminine mode over melodic and lyrical chanting, but switches to the martial mode when depicting the battle that led to his death.<br>
Most generally <em>kata</em> performed in feminine mode are characterized by a close position of the feet, round gesture, slower tempo and a fluid rhythm, whereas <em>kata</em> performed in martial mode have feet positioned further apart, more angular motion, faster tempo and sudden rhythms.<br>
For sake of comparison, several <em>kata</em>  included in the Catalog of Kata are presented both in feminine and martial modes. </p>

<p><em>Kata</em> are sequenced to create sophisticated stage motions and dances. Sequences of formal <em>kata</em> being abstract, reappear several times in a play and are also found in various plays. On the other hands, sequences including mimetic <em>kata</em> being text-related, are more moment-specific and are used to add a visual component that supports the text.</p>

<H4>Shimai and maibayashi</H4>
<p>Besides dance in the context of a Noh play, there are two other forms of dance. Dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em>,  such as <em>kuse</em> and <em>kiri</em>, can be performed independently from a play. This form of dance called <em>shimai</em> includes a jiutai usually composed of four members, but no <em>hayashi</em>.<br>
Instrumental dances can also be performed independently from a play. This form of dance called <em>maibayashi</em> includes a <em>hayashi</em> and a jiutai with a membership that can vary between three and eight singers.</p>

<p>When performing a <em>shimai</em> or <em>maibayashi</em>, the dancer is not masked and wears a crest-adorned <em>kimono</em> and  <em>hakama</em> rather than a costume. Moreover, the fan is larger than the one used in a play, and it is handled differently by the members of the jiutai. Whereas they kneel with hands in their pockets, fans resting on the stage floor when inactive, they hold the fan upwards when singing in a play, but hold it resting on their laps when singing in a <em>shimai</em> or <em>maibayashi</em>.</p>

<p>The substantial yet not exhaustive Catalog of Kata and Shimai Dances found on this website feature KONGŌ Tatsunori from the Kongō school.
