    <h1>Noh as intermedia</h1>
    <p>If one were to define intermedia as a way of forming expression by drawing on relationships between words, music and visuals, Noh Theater would be among its world’s most sophisticated and mighty exemplars. Zeami (c.1363-c.1443) who is credited with having perfected Noh as it still exists today, wrote in his Fûshikaden that in a successful play:</p> 
    <blockquote>
      <p class="blockquote__paragraph">… words should hold interest; the melody should be attractive; points of concentrated interest should be enacted with strong visual appeal. When all these elements come together at once, the entire audience is enchanted.</p> 
    </blockquote>
