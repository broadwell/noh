    <h2 id="Masks">Masks</h2>
    <p><em>By Diego Pellecchia</em></p>
    <h3 id="Intro">Introduction</h3>
<p>
There are over 200 types of noh masks, grouped in categories and types. One of the most common subdivisions conceives of five groups: god masks, female masks, male masks, spirit masks and demon masks. Masks used in the ritual performance Okina constitute an additional category. </p>
<p>
Most masks are associated with a character type (e.g. young woman, middle-aged woman, warrior, demon, etc.) and each shite school may allow a certain character to be performed with different types of mask. Only a few masks are used exclusively to portray a specific character in a single nō play (e.g. Yamamba, Shunkan, Semimaru). In addition, while most mask types are employed across schools, some others are specific to certain schools. For example, the same role of young woman may be portrayed with mask called Waka-onna (Kanze school), Fushiki-zō (Hōshō school), Magojirō or Ko-omote (Kongō school), or Ko-omote (Konparu and Kita schools).</p>


<p>Masks developed throughout the Muromachi period (1338-1573), and their use was canonized at the beginning of the 17th century. In the late sixteenth century, certain masks from each type were seen as superior and became standards (<em>honmen</em>) that were then replicated following a carving tradition that continues until today. Each of these <em>honmen</em> has a name (e.g. Kojō, Chūjō, Tobide), which is retained as the name of the copy (<em>utsushi</em>), thus establishing identifiable iconography for each name-type. Excellent masks made according to the dimensions and expression of the <em>honmen</em> became viable theatrical tools and are seen as having their own intrinsic identity. </p>

<p>Noh masks are carved using only natural materials and hand tools. A single block of <em>hinoki</em> (Japanese cypress) is carved into the shape of the mask, then it is covered with a white primer made with crushed shell and animal glue. The mask is then painted with mineral pigments. Finally, the carver may deliberately scar the mask to create a patina of age. No fixing agent or varnish is added on top of the mask, making it prone to further damage.</p>

<p>Today both ancient masks and copies are used in performance. Regardless of age, actors treat masks with the utmost care, bowing to them before using them in performance to express respect for the tradition they represent. It is thanks to this carefulness that ancient masks can still be used on stage today, after centuries of use.</p>

<h4>Mask: ‘Ko-omote’</h4>
<p>The name of this type of mask means ‘small face’. The use varies depending on the shite school. Kongō school uses Ko-omote to portray any kind of young female character: from a country girl to a court lady, from a flower spirit to a goddess. </p>

<p>Ko-omote represents the idealized face of an aristocratic young woman from the Heian period (794-1185), which was considered as the standard of elegance in medieval Japan. Ko-omote masks feature a fair complexion, with three thick hairlines neatly combed along the sides and fuzzy eyebrows painted high on the forehead. The teeth are dyed black. This make-up and hair style follow Heian-period aesthetics, though the mask may be used to portray any kind of female character, even from later eras. The mask’s plump cheeks and small lips, and the proportions of the small triangle formed between the eyes, nose and mouth give the mask a youthful look. </p>

<p>The mask is used in combination with a, long black wig (<em>kazura</em>) which, in the case of Hashitomi, is kept bound behind the neck, and hidden under the upper garment. The hair wig is parted in the middle and combed along the sides of the face, in correspondence with the painted hair. The ears of the actor are hidden under the hair.</p>

<p>In the case of Hashitomi, Ko-omote is the standard choice in the Kongō school to represent the face of Yūgao, a young aristocratic lady from the Heian period. The Kanze school uses Waka-onna, offering the alternatives of Ko-omote and Fukai, the mask of a middle-aged woman. The Hōshō school uses its standard young woman mask, Fushikizō.</p>

<p>Shimo-gakari shite schools (Komparu, Kongō, and Kita) schools use Ko-omote for both shite and tsure (companion) roles, though they often distinguish between specific Ko-omote masks reserving certain ones for shite roles and assigning others with less complex expressions for tsure roles. The Kongō school treasures one of the most famous Ko-omote masks, called Yuki-no-Ko-omote (snow Ko-omote), which is said to have been created by the renown mask carver Tatsuemon in the Muromachi period (1338-1573).</p>

<h4>First Act Mask: ‘Dōji’</h4>

<p>The name of this mask literally means ‘boy’. The mask is used invariably for either a deity or a spirit in disguise in the first half of a play (e.g. Tamura, Kokaji, Shakkyō) or for roles of Chinese immortal (Makura-jidō, Hōsō, etc.). According to nō conventions, masks are not used for roles of adult males, unless the character is the personification of a supernatural creature, or some other kind of special character.</p>

<p>The mask represents the face of a boy, with natural eyebrows, elongated eyes, and a natural smile. The expression is devoid of any wrinkle or furrows, contributing to a youthful look. The painted uncombed hair suggests young age and is matched with the large black <em>kashira</em> wig used in combination with this mask.</p>

<h4 id="Kokaji2">Second Act Mask: ‘Ō-tobide’</h4>

<p>The name of this mask literally means ‘large jump/pop out’ and refers to its eyes, which appear as if they were popping out of the eye-sockets, and to its larger size in comparison to ‘ko-tobide’. This type of mask is used for a variety of roles, including the deity of Mt. Inari in the form of a fox-god (Kokaji), or the rain and thunder deity Wake-ikazuchi in Kamo.</p>

<p>The mask is entirely covered with gold paint and features golden metal inserts for the eyes. According to noh conventions, gold symbolizes the supernatural nature of a character. The arched eyebrows, open wide round eyes, open mouth, and pointed moustache give the impression of an outburst of energy. The mask is used in combination with red or white <em>kashira</em> wig.</p>

<p>Different masks can be used for the shite in the second half of Kokaji, depending on the performance variant and on the shite school. For the standard version of the play, in which the shite in the second half wears a red wig, the mask usually used is ko-tobide, a smaller mask with a reddish complexion. Ō-tobide, instead, is used for variant performances. The Kongō school, however, allows Ō-tobide to be used even with the standard staging of the play, shown in the video.</p>
