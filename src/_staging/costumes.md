    <h2 id="Costumes">Costumes (<em>Hashitomi</em> and <em>Kokaji</em>)</h2>
    <p> Noh costumes define a characterʼs gender, profession, and rank. Their layered elements are prescribed by tradition and can be found noted at the beginning of the <em>utaibon</em> (libretto). While the types of garments for a given play are regulated, their colors, patterns, and in some cases mimetic techniques serve as a tool for the actorʼs expression. In choosing the costume for a character the actor considers the image to be portrayed, the overall atmophere of the performance, and the balance of colors, patterns, and motif sizes as they play off the costumes of other characters. The performer usually has a stock of costumes from which to choose. Heads of schools and other actor families that own theaters as well as some individual actors have costumes collected over a long time span.</p>

<p>
Nō costumes can be divided into four basic categories: (1) <em>kosode</em> “small-sleeved”, T-shaped, straight-lined, full-length garments similar to a modern kimono, with wrist-length sleeves that have their cuff edge sewn up half way to form a pocket. (2) <em>ōsode</em> or <em>hirosode</em> “broad-sleeved” outer garments. The various styles of <em>ōsode</em> outer garments all have extra wide sleeves, often double the weaving width, that are open at the cuff. These are worn over a <em>kosode</em> and are generally three-quarter length. (3) <em>hakama</em>, variously translated as trousers, pleated pants, or divided skirts depending on how voluminous they are. (4) accessories, including hairbands (<em>kazura-obi</em>), waist sashes (<em>koshi-obi</em>), head covers like crowns, hats, and helmets, and hand-held objects such as fans, prayer beads, weapons, sticks, and ritual objects.</p>

<p>Whereas Western flutists use the distal phalanges to cover the instrument's key and holes, the nohkan players use their intermediate phalanges allowing for very subtle half-holing that produces additional microtonal fluctuations in the pitch.</p><p>

The microtonal and unregulated pitch material of the nohkan is meant to function independently from the singers. The chant's central pitch is set by the primary actor during the performance, independently from the nohkan's pitches. The overall compatibility of energy and sometimes pitch is part of a natural process happening in response to the circumstances and spirit of a particular performance.  This freedom between the pitch material of the actors and the nohkan is also facilitated by their separation in range, the nohkan being much higher than the chant.</p><p>

The mode of attack is another important factor that adds to the richness of nohkan's sound palette. To enunciate new notes the nohkan players use increased air pressure controlled by the diaphragm. This allows for differing sharpness of attacks from sudden to slurred. Tonguing, a common performance practice of the West involving making a silent use of syllables like "ta" or "da" to break the flow of air is not used.</p>

<h3 id="Patterns">Melodic Patterns</h3>
    <p>The role of the nohkan is to create an ambiance that reflects the particular emotions of the play, the status or psychological mindset of a character in a given section, as well as to underline the dramatic structure. This is achieved using a collection of just over a hundred melodic patterns and pieces that are shared between different plays. This fixed melodic repertoire consists of different kinds of material: <em>ashirai</em> patterns that are relatively short and are used multiple times throughout each play; special patterns that are associated with particular emotions or situations such as love, shinto rituals, purifications, mantra chanting etc.; pieces that accompany dance, entrances and exits; and pieces used exclusively for kyōgen. In Morita school there are around 20 <em>ashirai</em> patterns, 80 special patterns and pieces for entrance, exit and dance (the number includes variations such as different introduction patterns for dances) and 12 pieces for kyōgen. What adds to the immense richness of the nohkan music is that in performance, the same patterns are inflected with expressive characteristics that serve the demands of a specific play, section and structural moment.</p>
    <p>
    In the hope to provide the user with a reference to better appreciate the expressive transformation of the same pattern we asked MORITA Yasuyoshi to perform ‘generic' versions of the patterns that could then be compared with their use within the plays. He was at first reluctant, since no ‘generic’ versions are ever performed. Patterns are always learned and played in the context of a specific play, with a particular character in mind. We appreciate the exception he made for this website and its educational purpose. Within the catalog that follows, two patterns: <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane/"><em>Naka no takane</em></a> and <a href="/music/nohkan/takenemikusari/"><em>Takane mi kusari</em></a>  are first heard in their 'generic' form and then played as performed in Kokaji <em>Kuse</em> involving a male God, compared with Hashitomi <em>Kuse</em> which involves a young maiden.</p>

    <p>The transmission of music for nokan is primarily oral. To help memorization a system of mnemonics called shoga is used. These are also notated. Specific combinations of syllables represent specific melodic contour and fingering relative to central note and mode. The direction of pitch is suggested by the use of vowels, which if ordered from highest to lowest are: i, a, o and u. However, there is no fixed relationship between a single mnemonic syllable and specific pitch or fingering. As a result, written notation has only a secondary role and is not sufficient in itself. Examples of mnemonics include: <em>o, u, hi, ra, ri, ru, ro, hya, hyu, hyo,</em> among others. For example of patterns, the shoga for <em>takane</em> is: "<em>o-hya ra</em>". It is important to note that each syllable represents a sound often composed of a sequence of pitches rather than a single one. Shoga does not carry any information about its duration, since it changes depending on context.</p>

    <p>Finally, a word about the <em>hishigi</em> – a shrill, high-pitched tone that is rarely used within melodies. It is used primarily as a powerful and striking effect sometimes described as an invocation to gods. It often marks the end of a play, or the beginning or end of a section.</p>

    <h4 id="Catalog">Selected Examples</h4>
    <p>In presenting this selection of melodic materials our objective was to record only the principal 9 <em>ashirai</em> patterns that can be heard in one or both of the plays featured on this website: Kokaji and Hashitomi. For some context, in the notation book of Morita school 14 patterns appear in the play Funabenkei, only 5 in Soshi Arai Komachi, 15 in Kokaji and 8 in Hashitomi</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>To illustrate how patterns are used to articulate the structure of a section we will use the example of the first <em>Ageuta</em> section from Hashitomi. Three melodic patterns are usually performed during an <em>Ageuta</em> (a sung section): <em>takane, naka no takane,</em> and <em>mi roku no ge</em>. They stand out because they are relatively short, they each appear only once and as distinct utterances, played at their own specific point in the section.</p>

    <p>First, the sequence of the patterns accentuates the melodic shape of the chant which starts in the higher range, moves to the middle  and closes in the low range. This descent is imitated by the nohkan's sequence of patterns, which start with <em>takane</em> followed by <em>naka no takane</em>, both in the instrument's higher range followed by the <em>mi roku no ge</em> whose melodic contour moves from the medium to the low range.</p>

    <p>Second, the positioning of the patterns also underlines the structure of the text, which is characterized by a repeated first and last line. The reiteration of the first line is preceded by the nohkan's <em>takane</em> pattern, while the first statement of the last line of text is underlined by the entrance of the <em>mi roku no ge</em> pattern. The <em>naka no takane</em> does not have a specific position, but it is usually played at the point where the vocal line is about to move from the higher to the medium range.</p>

    <p>There are exceptions to this basic structure, for instance, the <em>naka no takane</em> is left out from the first ageuta from Hashitomi, which is short. Its second ageuta being even shorter, only includes the first nohkan pattern: <em>takane</em>.</p>

    <h3 id="Rhythm">Rhythm</h3>
    <p>The nohkan performs solo, with the percussion instruments or with percussion instruments and voice. It never plays with the voice alone. For the majority of its repertoire, the nohkan’s part is non-congruent meaning that it is not synchronized to specific beats within the eight-beat unit. Depending on the situation, the nohkan player relies on either the text, the position of an actor on the stage, or an approximate point within the eight-beat unit to determine the beginning and end of their melodic pattern. For instance, when playing the solo piece <em>nanoribue</em>, an entrance music commonly played as the waki is walking onto the stage, the pace of the performance is guided by the time taken by the actor to walk from his entrance point to the speech position.</p><p>
The <em>nanoribue</em> is based on three <em>ashirai</em> patterns: <em>naka no takane</em>, <em>roku no ge</em>, and an unnamed third one exclusive to the <em>nanoribue</em>.</p>

<p>When performing with the percussion instruments, there are three different types of possible rhythmic arrangements:</p><p>
1.	The nohkan part is congruent, meaning that it aligns with specific beats of the eight-beat unit (<em>honji</em>). This is the case for all dances and some entrance and exit music.</p><p>

2.	The nohkan's part is non-congruent, meaning that it does not align with the <em>honji</em>’s beats and it is set against a strict percussion part.<br>
3. The nohkan’s non-congruent part is set against a flexible percussion part.
</p>
<h4 id="Congruent">Congruent</h4>
<p>The nohkan part is congruent for all dances and some entrance and exit music. In these instances, the nohkan’s melodic patterns almost always start on the <em>honji</em>’s second beat or its second half. Its material is developed from short motives that are juxtaposed to create a larger melodic cell. For instance, the melody that accompanies the dance <em>maibataraki</em> found on this website is composed of three melodic motives: a, b, c, where each letter corresponds to an eight-beat melody. These motives performed as a set create a twenty-four beat long melody.
On the other hand, the <em>Jo no mai</em>’s core melody called <em>Ji</em>  is composed of four patterns, each eight-beat long, labelled: <em>Chū, Kan, Kan no chū,</em> and <em>Ryō</em>.

<h4 id="Non-congruent-Strict">Non-congruent in Strict Setting</h4>
<p>An example of a non-congruent nohkan’s part against a strict percussion part is provided with an excerpt from the <em>Issei</em>-music from Hagoromo. This is an entrance music that typically leads to the <em>Issei</em>-chant, where the percussion’s strict rhythmic setting is maintained against a non-congruent chant.
After having articulated the beginning of the module with the <em>Hishigi</em> pattern, the nohkan players waits for the fourth <em>honji</em> to freely position the <em>Naka no takane</em> pattern in the span of two <em>honji</em>.

<p> An example of a non-congruent nohkan’s part against a flexible percussion part is provided with an excerpt from the <em>Shidai-music</em> from Atsumori. This is an entrance music that typically leads to the <em>Shidai</em>-chant, where the percussion setting switches to strict against a congruent chant.
After having articulated the beginning of the module with the <em>Hishigi</em> pattern, the nohkan players waits for the fourth <em>honji</em> to freely position the <em>Takane mi kusari</em> pattern in the span of two <em>honji</em>. </p>
