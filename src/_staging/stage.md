    <h2 id="Stage">Stage</h2>
    <p> The Noh stage is unique in its shape and components. First of all, it has a single entrance/exit for the actors designated by a multicolored curtain on the back-right side (directions are given in relationship with an imaginary actor standing in center stage facing the front audience). It opens up to a bridge sided with three pine trees that leads to the stage proper. This is the main space and is squared shape. A pine tree adorns the back wall and an extended space in the back and right side of the stage accommodate the musicians and jiutai’s members, respectively. The stage has four pillars and is covered by a roof that extends over the bridge. There is a small sliding door on the back-left corner of the stage that the stage attendants and jiutai members use to enter and leave the stage. Finally, the audience seating space spreads from the right side to the front of the stage.</p><p>

The roof above the stage testifies of the origins of Noh that only moved in-doors in 1882. It also symbolizes the sanctity of the space it covers, another testimony to its origins in the sacred architecture of shrines.</p><p>

The painted pine tree on the back wall of the stage is said to remind us of the outdoor origins of Noh. It is also said to be a symbol of the famous Yōgō Pine at the Kasuga Shrine in Nara where Noh has been performed for centuries.</p><p>

The stage proper is squared shape and can be divided into 3 x 3 sub-squares, numbered from 1 to 9.</p><p id="Squares"></p>

    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Noh-Stage-2.png" %}
    <p>The sub-squares do not all share the same dramatic potential since a dance motion is more powerful or subdued depending on where it is performed. Squares 3, 4, and 9 are the strongest positions: square 3 because it is the point of convergence of all the audience’s viewing points, square 4 because it is center front stage, and square 9 because it is center stage:</p>
<p>Square 1 and 8 are used as starting and/or closing location for a dance or dance segment.</p>
<p>Square 7 is almost never used since it interferes with the position of the nohkan player.</p>
<p>Square 5 is usually occupied by the sitting waki since this is where the he sits after completing his entrance.</p>
<p>Square 2 and 6 are often used as intermediate positions in motion from back to front stage or vice versa.</p>
<p>There are also certain conventions associated with the stage:</p>

<p>The four pillars that sustain the roof are named: the right backstage pillar is referred to as the shite-pillar while the right front stage pillar is called the viewing-pillar being at the crossing point of all seating. The left backstage pillar is referred to as the flute-pillar because this is where the nohkan player sits, while the left front stage pillar is called the waki-pillar because this is where he sits when he is not actively participating to the action.</p>

<p>It is said that under some Noh stages large empty clay jars are placed to act as resonance body to amplify the sound of the shite’s stamping, as well as the sound of the drums, flute, and voices from the jiutai.</p>

<p>Another unique feature of the Noh stage is the upstage right, narrow bridge used by actors to access the stage proper.  Although it is also used as a performing space, the bridge is first and foremost the link that connects two separate realities: the everyday world in which otherworldly ghosts and spirits frequently appear. This abstraction is furthermore reinforced by the three small pine trees located along the bridge, where the first, biggest and nearest one to the stage stands for heaven, while the third one, smallest the closest to the curtain represents earth, both surrounding the middle pine tree, which symbolizes mankind.</p>

<p>The simplicity of the Noh stage allows for various reinterpretations of its space. For instance, the stage represents three different places for the entrance of the three characters in Kokaji’s first act entrance. The first one to appear is the waki-tsure, an imperial envoy. Thus, the bridge and stage are understood to be the palace where he works. The second character to enter is the waki, Munechika the swordsmith, and at that moment, the bridge represents his house or factory. Finally, when the shite appears, the bridge as well as the stage should be seen as somewhere outside of  Munechika’s house, the same Munechika who at that moment is on his way to the Inari shrine, and once he sets on Square 6, we understand it to represent the shrine.
In Kokaji’s second act, the addition of a prop helps identify a specific location, since the dais on Square 4 represents Munichika’s forge.</p>

<p>Things are a bit different for the entrance of Hashitomi’s two characters. The first one to appear is the waki, a monk living in Unrin-in Temple in Murasakino of Kitayama in Kyoto. Thus, the bridge and stage are understood to represent that temple. Things are little less obvious though with the entrance of the shite, a woman. As the monk is about to celebrate a mass for the flowers he notices an unusual white one among his lot, and as he wonders about it, the woman speaks for the flower. Some say that she is the flower’s voice, other say that she is physically present.
The choreography adopted by the Kongō school appears to support the former, where the large distance between the two characters involved in a dialogue, as he is kneeling on Square 6 as she is standing on the Bridge at the second pine, suggest that the waki can hear but maybe not see her.
Like in Kokaji’s second act, a prop is also added for Hashitomi’s second act, that helps identify a specific location, since the prop standing on Square 8 represents the woman’s dwelling.</p>
