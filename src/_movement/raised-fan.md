    <h2>Raised Fan (<em>ageha</em>)</h2>

    <p>All Point patterns involve raising the right arm and pointing the fan. The different names come from the motion perform by the arm leading to the pointing conclusion.</p>

    <p>The open fan is brought up in front of the face in a circular fashion.  From this position three back steps are combined with a raise of the fan over the head, which is then brought to the side of the body, again in a circular fashion.</p>

    <p>While it can be performed independently, it is usually performed by the shite as he sings a one- or two-line solo in the upper range, at the beginning of the third part of the <em>kuse</em>. This solo is also called ageha.</p>
