    <h2>Catalog of Shōdan</h2>
    <p>The music of Noh can be seen as modular not only because of the prescribed vocabulary of melodic and rhythmic patterns that are reused in multiple plays but also because these patterns form larger standard modules (<em>shōdan</em>) that can be found in multiple plays serving similar structural and dramatic functions. There are around one hundred different types of modules that can be categorized into four types: Spoken (<em>kotoba</em>), Chanted (<em>au</em>), Entrance and Exit music, and Dance music.
 </p><p>
The following partial catalog is limited to modules from the two plays featured in this website: Kokaji and Hashitomi. To prioritize information about musical characteristics the <em>shōdan</em> were recorded in a recital style performance an the videos are overlayed with simplified notation. </p>
