        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The action takes place on the stage's bridge, which represents the entrance to Munechika’s house. The wakizure (imperial envoy) standing at the First Pine calls for Munechika. The curtain is raised, the waki (Munechika) dressed in <a href="/staging/costumes/#Kokaji-Waki1" target="_blank">"street clothes" of a samurai</a>, walks in. He stops at the Third Pine, kneels and bows to the wakizure. They remain in their positions throughout the ensuing dialogue.</div>

    <p>The overall dramatic intensity increases with the introduction of a second actor and performance of mimetic movements. Munechika greets the envoy with a <time datetime='00:05:41.000' title='00:05:41'>customary bow</time>. Upon hearing that he is to forge a sword for the Emperor, doubting his abilities, Munechika tries to find a way to decline the request. The envoy getting impatient, delivers his last line: “Let me repeat the imperial command”, with a forceful style of singing called <em><time datetime='00:08:32.000' title='00:08:32'>suteru</time></em>, stressing his order with a commanding step towards the waki.
    The conclusion of the spoken exchange is temporarily delayed with the <em>Ageuta-1</em>, which exposes Munechika's troublied inner feelings, considering the prodigious request.</p>
