  <p>CAN WE PUT THIS PARAGRAPH IN THE CATALOG OF SHODAN? The <em>sashi’s</em> overall texture is quite complex since the chant and nohkan parts are non-congruent, accompanied by the two-hand percussion set in flexible rhythm. In this context, it is the percussionists’ responsibility to adapt their sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns to the chant whose tempo is in constant flux.</p>



  <p>WHERE DOES THIS GO? IT IS NOT INTERMEDIA. The text focuses exclusively on Emperor Huan Tsung (713 – 742 AD) who dreamed about his late Minister Chung K’ei coming to his defense with a sword. </p><p>
  Although the young boy and jiutai alternate in singing, this is not a true dialogue since the jiutai sings the boy’s words lecturing Munechika. </p>

  <p>The Intermedia Index rises slightly with the shite chanting in addition to the jiutai. Their exchange is purely formal as the jiutai speaks the shite's mind. An aditional boost of energy is provided in the <time datetime='00:19:11.000' title='00:19:11'> conclusive words </time> about the swords: “and their miraculous power is beyond expression!” by the shite rutning to face the waki and by the nohkan introducing the <em> kuse no ryō</em> pattern.</p>
