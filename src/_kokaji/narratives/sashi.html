  <p>The <em>sashi’s</em> overall texture is quite complex since the chant and nohkan parts are non-congruent, accompanied by the two-hand percussion set in flexible rhythm. In this context, it is the percussionists’ responsibility to adapt their sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns to the chant whose tempo is in constant flux.</p>

  <p>The text focuses exclusively on Emperor Huan Tsung (713 – 742 AD) who dreamed about his late Minister Chung K’ei coming to his defense with a sword. <br>
  Although the young boy and jiutai alternate in singing, this is not a true dialogue since the jiutai sings the boy’s words lecturing Munechika. </p>

  <p> The point of intermedia interest of this <em>shōdan</em> focuses on how music and <em>kata</em> can reinforce the text.</p>

  <p>The young boy’s <time datetime='00:18:51.000' title='00:18:51'> second statement </time>, the slowest of all announces the end of his lecture, leaving it to the jiutai to deliver his <time datetime='00:19:11.000' title='00:19:11'> conclusive words </time> about the swords: “and their miraculous power is beyond expression!”. The importance of this last statement is furthermore reinforced by two coincidental actions: the young boy engaging Munechika by sliding left to face him, just as the nohkan introduces its <em> kuse no ryō</em> pattern.</p>

  <p> Having made his case, the boy slides back to face the audience at the conclusion of the <em>sashi</em>.</p>
