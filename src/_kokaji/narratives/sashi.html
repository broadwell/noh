  <p> Following a sequence of unaccompanied <em>shōdan</em> delivered in spoken mode, the first <em>ageuta</em> with its accompanied poetic text came across as the closing highlight of the Waki enters section.  The situation is the same with the second <em>ageuta</em>, which itself follows three <em>shōdan</em> delivered in spoken mode. Its accompanied poetic text paired with the first dance movements make it the closing highlight of the Shite enters section.</p>

  <p> This <em>shōdan</em> has two points of intermedia interest related to the metric setting of text, and the interpretation of abstract <em>kata</em>.</p>

  <p> The <em>shōdan’s</em> poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> is entirely sung by the jiutai who speaks for the shite. As it sings “<em>Nothing shall dim the radiance of the Emperor’s sword</em>”, a four-beat measure (<a href="/music/voices/#Size"target="_blank"><em>toriji</em></a>) is introduced, leading to the line of 8 + 5 syllables:“<em>Kumo no uebito no mitsurugi no/ The Emperor’s sword</em>”. The <em>toriji</em> adds four more beats for this line, far exceeding its needed thirteen syllable slots. Thus, a time gap delays the beginning of the line, thereby stressing the importance of its <time datetime='00:15:48.000' title='00:15:48'> text </time>. </p>

  <p>It is interesting to notice that the use of space also supports the text. At the beginning of the <em>ageuta</em> the two protagonists are apart and with little eye contact, symbolizing the psychological divide between the two. Starting on <time datetime='00:15:37.000' title='00:15:37'> Square 1 </time>, the shite performs the standard sequence Forward Pointing and Open-retreat that takes him to Square 2, where he faces the waki after performing a Left Step Pivot. He then takes Three Steps, coming the closest to the waki this far in the play, just as the jiutai refers to the Emperor’s sword. This sequence of kata is used in all plays, yet it is the synchronization between text and movements that provides it with a meaning specific to this moment in the play. </p>

  <p> At the beginning of the <time datetime='00:16:12.000' title='00:16:12'> second part </time>, whose beginning is signaled by the nohkan’s <em>naka no takane</em> pattern, the shite, as if sensing that the waki needs more time to befriend his presence,  moves away and circles back to Square 1, where he performs once again the same sequence of <em>kata</em>: Forward pointing, Open-retreat, and a Left Step Pivot, but thiss timne Munechika turns towards the shite, acknowledging his presence. The shite takes One Step towards the waki, as they once again stand facing each other, but now as allies.</p>
