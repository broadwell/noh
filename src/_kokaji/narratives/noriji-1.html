  <p>The intermedia point of interest of the <em>shōdan</em> is at the formal level, as we look at how the <em>noriji</em> correlates with its two adjacent <em>shōdan</em>. The analysis shows that while the visual component appears rather static, the music gains in momentum.</p>

  <p> The <em>noriji-1</em> is <time datetime='00:48:40.000' title='00:48:40'>visually static</time>, setting the proper tone for the delivery of a prayer. Munechika  remaining on the dais starts waving his sacred wand as the jiutai, speaking for him, calls for divine help.
  On the other hand, the music is building momentum with its faster tempo and  larger instrumentation. First, the chant is now sung by the jiutai compared to a single voice in the preceding <em>notto</em>. Moreover, the taiko has now joined in. Although it participated to the performance of the <em>raijo</em>, it is for the first time in the play that it participates to the accompaniment of a chant.</p>

  <p> Set in congruent <em>ōnori</em>, the text counts in average eight syllables per <em>honji</em>, in net contrast with the <em>notto’s</em> non-congruent chant. </p>

  <p>Finally, it is interesting to consider the fact that this <em>noriji</em> precedes the <em>hayafue</em>, the entrance music for the second-act shite who personifies a divine being. Even in Noh, the advent of a deity is a miracle, and a miracle can only be created when the power of prayers gets to a climactic level. Thus, the building up of the momentum in the music leads towards the dramatic line ‘<em><time datetime='00:50:51.000' title='00:50:51'>kinjo-saihai</time></em>’ (the word for prayer) sung first by Munechika, concluded by the jiutai, setting the tone for the dynamic <em>hayafue</em> and the entrance of the second-act shite.</p>
