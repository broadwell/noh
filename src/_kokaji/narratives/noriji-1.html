  <p>The intermedia point of interest of the <em>shōdan</em> is at the formal level, as we look at how the <em>noriji</em> correlates with its two adjacent <em>shōdan</em>. The analysis shows that while the visual component appears rather static, the music gains in momentum.</p>

  <p> The <em>noriji-1</em> is <time datetime='00:48:40.000' title='00:48:40'>visually static</time>, setting the proper tone for the delivery of a prayer. Munechika  remaining on the dais starts waving his Sacred wand as the jiutai, speaking for him, calls for divine help.
  On the other hand, the music is building momentum with its faster tempo and  larger instrumentation, as the sung chant is delivery by the jiutai compared with a single voice in the preceding <em>notto</em>, and with the addition of the taiko. Although it joined in with the other instruments for the <em>raijo</em>, it is participating to the accompaniment of a chant for the first time in the play. </p>

  <p> Set in the congruent <em>ōnori</em>, the text counts in average eight syllables per <em>honji</em>, in net contrast with the <em>notto’s</em> non-congruent chant. Moreover, the <em>ōnori</em> with its limited number of syllables and its immutable <em>honji</em> is often used as a mean to prepare for a coming dance, as it is indeed the case here.</p>

  <p>It is alsso interesting to consider the fact that this <em>noriji</em> precedes the <em>hayafue</em>, the entrance music for the second-act shite who personifies a divine being. Even in Noh, the advent of a deity is a miracle, and a miracle can only be created when the power of prayers gets to a climactic level. Thus, the building up of the momentum in the music leads towards the climactic line ‘<time datetime='00:50:51.000' title='00:50:51'><em>kinjo-saihai</em></time>’ (the word for prayer) sung first by Munechika, concluded by the jiutai, setting the tone for the dynamic <em>hayafue</em> and the entrance of the second-act shite.</p>
