  <p>The Intermedia Index rises as the music of the <em>noriji 1</em> becomes congruent with the poetic text set in <em>ōnori</em> and the accompaniment of the three percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting. The intermedia interest of the <em>noriji 1</em> lies in how it fits with the adjacent <em>shōdan</em>. </p>


  <p>In preparation for the delivery of a prayer, the <em>noriji-1</em> is <time datetime='00:48:40.000' title='00:48:40'> visually static</time>. Munechika kneeling on the <a href="/staging/props/#Kokaji" target="_blank"><em>dais</em></a> waves a sacred wand as the jiutai speaking for him, calls for divine help. On the other hand, the music builds momentum with its faster tempo and larger instrumentation. The chant is now sung by the jiutai compared to a single voice in the preceding <em>notto</em> and the taiko returns with its first entrance in Act II. </p>


  <p>The <em>noriji 1</em> leads to the <em>hayafue</em>, the entrance music that will bring on stage the second-act shite personifying a divine being. The advent of a deity is a miracle and a climax that is artfully produced by using text and tempo. Set in <em>ōnori</em>, the poetic text counts in average eight syllables per <em>honji</em>. In preparation for the swordsmith’s statement of entreaty “<em>hear and grant my prayer</em>”, the tempo is substantially slowed down by the taiko pattern switching <time datetime='00:50:29.000' title='00:50:29'> from two to one stroke per beat</time>. This leads to the dramatic line “<em><time datetime='00:50:51.000' title='00:50:51'>kinjo-saihai</time></em>”, which means a prayer. At this point the text setting switches to non-congruent and slows down with only three syllables per <em>honji</em>. The waki sings the first word, the jiutai the second. Against the slow-down in the vocal line, the percussion instruments’ create an accelerando that sets the tone for the dynamic <em>hayafue</em> and the entrance of the second-act shite. </p>
