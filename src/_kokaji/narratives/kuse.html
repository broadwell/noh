<p>This <em>shōdan</em> represents the highlight of the first act, as it introduces the play’s first dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em>. It tells the story of first century Yamato-dake, son of legendary Emperor Keikō, who feared the brutal temperament of his son who had slewed his elder brother. Thus, to keep him at distance, he sent him to the Eastern provinces, but before leaving, Yamato-dake met with his aunt Princess Yamato-hime, who lent him a holy sword named '<em>Kunasagi no tsurugi</em>'. Yamato-dake went to the eastern land where he defeated the enemy.
</p>

  <p> The point of intermedia interest of this <em>shōdan</em> focuses on the use of mimicking <em>kata</em> that provide the text with a visual representation.</p>

  <p> Based on the text and the use of the dance space, the <em>kuse</em>can be divided up into two parts. During the entire first part the shite remains knelling in center stage as the jiutai sings his words. It tells the story of Yamato-Dake and how he subdued the barbarians from the Eastern provinces. Upon reaching the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"><em>uchikiri</em></a>, which marks more or less the first part’s half-point and concludes the story’s introduction, the shite makes his very first move as he <time datetime='00:23:42.000' title='00:23:42'>slides left</time> to face his addressee who is kneeling on Square 6, thus reminding all that it is for Munechika’s sake that this story is being told.</p>

  <p> The second half of the first part focuses on a specific incident that illustrates the power and protection provided by the Yamato-dake’s sword '<em>Kunasagi no tsurugi</em>'. As we are told that at the time of the event the autumnal colors were fading away,  the shite slides to the right, grabs his forelock, raises on his knee, and <time datetime='00:24:47.000' title='00:24:47'> stares in the distance </time> at the fading fall colors.</p>

  <p> In a context of limited movement, as it is the case with the <em>kuse’s</em> first part, head motion can carry substantial meaning as shown with the following two examples. The first one comes as the shite recalls that he was surrounded on every side by the barbarians. His Right-Left-Right <time datetime='00:25:12.000' title='00:25:12'> Head motion </time> shows that he was well aware of his precarious situation. On the other hand, his <time datetime='00:25:45.000' title='00:25:45'> Downward Head motion </time>, as the jiutai refers to the “beating enemies’ war drums”, suggests that he is assessing the situation.</p>

<p>The first part closes with the jiutai referring to “…the towering flames as the attack blazed forward.". At this moment, the shite as if ready to act, <time datetime='00:25:53.000' title='00:25:53'> half rises on his knee </time> and faces front, as he is about to deliver his third and last intervention.</p>

<section id='part2' title='Part II' class='tabbed-narrative'>
    <div class="section-introduction__term">Intermedia Part-II</div>
       <p>The <em>kuse’s</em> second part further showcases Yamato-dake’s sword prowess. Helped by the kotsuzumi's patterns which incorporate up-beat strokes, the overall tempo of this part is faster than the preceding one. Yet, the active dance is the element that truly differentiates it from the preceding one. It is also from this point that the shite’s role switches from narrator to the impersonation of Yamato-dake.</p>

  <p>Thus, as he sings that the “<time datetime='00:26:12.000' title='00:26:12'> Prince drew his sword </time>”, the shite uses his fan as a sword that he points straight in front of him. He then stands up and takes four steps towards the strong Square 4, and performs two standard <em>kata</em> often used at the beginning of a dance: Forward pointing and Open-retreat, as he continues to use his fan as a sword lashing it <time datetime='00:26:44.000' title='00:26:44'> left and right </time> over the words “As it mowed down the grasses in all directions”.</p>

  <p>As he performs a sequence of Four Stamps, the shite Opens his Fan, thus marking the start of the dance’s high point. He then takes a series of steps that brings him from front- to back-stage (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 8</a>), temporarily <time datetime='00:26:50.000' title='00:26:50'> relaxing the tension </time>.</p>

  <p>From this point on, the shite starts rebuilding momentum by performing a Scooping Point that carries him back to the strong Square 4 where he performs a Right Circlet to mimic the words “<time datetime='00:27:02.000' title='00:27:02'> covered the earth </time>” in the sentence “The blaze lit up the heavens, covered the earth! ”.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the words “A furnace of fierce flames, turned back to devour the enemy forces. ”, the shite moves to the very strong Square 3, glances Left-Right-Left-Right-Down at the enemy and uses his fan as if <time datetime='00:27:08.000' title='00:27:08'> controlling the flames </time> that he releases towards the barbarians, with a Pointing to the Right, as he Takes the Corner.</p>

  <p>Then, he starts a Large Circle to the Left, but stops on Square 5 to perform a Scooping point followed by a Single Right Stamp that marks a <time datetime='00:27:26.000' title='00:27:26'> sudden slowdown in the tempo </time>, that announces the dance’s imminent conclusion. It is over the words “So in later years”, that the speed drops, suggesting that the narration of Yamato-dake’s exploits is over. On his way back to Square 8, the shite Closes his Fan confirming that the dance is coming to an end, and upon reaching his destination, he performs the standard sequence of Scooping Point, and an Open-retreat. </p>

  <p>The introduction of a <a href="/music/voices/#Size"target="_blank"><em>toriji</em></a>  before an eight-beat measure (<em>honji</em>) provides a line of text with a total twenty-four syllabic positions, a number that usually far exceed the text’s needs. The outcome is that rather than spreading the text over the increased number of beats, a larger than usual number of unsung beats is added before the line, thus highlighting itss first few words, as it resumes.
  The added <em>toriji</em> that leads to the words: “And now…” is important, since it confirms that the narration of Yamato-dake’s story is over and that we are now switching to reality, hence this is now the young boy who is speaking directly to Munechika.
  Therefore, as the jiutai intones “And now, this auspiciously omened blade that you must forge! ”, the <time datetime='00:28:05.000' title='00:28:05'> tempo gradually increases </time>. </p>

  <p>Thus, the boy turns towards Square 6 and faces Munechika as he takes one step towards him. But as if feeling that he must stress his point, he rather turns back and goes to <time datetime='00:28:23.000' title='00:28:23'> Square 1 </time>, where after pivoting to face Munechika, he performs a Scooping Point and in an insisting fashion, keeps his pointing position as he takes six steps towards the swordsmith just as the jiutai sings “Munechika, heir to a house of proud tradition? Set your heart at rest and go home now! ”.
  The tempo having gradually slowed down to its slowest speed, the shite now in the strong Square 9 concludes the dance with an Open-retreat before Kneeling finishing the <em>kuse</em>, at the same place and same position he started it.</p>
