  <p>The <em>shōdan</em> marks a sharp return to one of the simplest textures: reciting voices with factual text accompanied by sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji"target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns. It also presents an interesting point of intermedia interest related to mode of delivery.</p>

  <p> At the conclusion of a spoken exchange during which Munechika confirms that he accepts the imperial request, the young boy switches to non-congruent singing in <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin"target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a> mode, thus producing a serious and commanding tone, as he stands on his knee and dramatically announces that <time datetime='00:29:53.000' title='00:29:53'> he will return </time>.
  The change of mode of delivery combined with a Raising on knee motion highlight the importance of the text. Moreover, it also links this shite with the one who will be coming in the second act, whose overall look will be quite different.</p>
