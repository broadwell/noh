        <div class="section-introduction__definition">Munechika indicates that hearing of the legendary Chinese and Japanese swords has gladdened his heart. Yet he presses the young boy to reveal his identity. The latter evades the question by suggesting that Munechika should prepare his forge’s mount and waits for his return.

  <p>The <em>shōdan</em> marks a sharp return to one of the simplest textures: reciting voices with factual text accompanied by sparse <a href="/music/Otsuzumi&Kotsuzumi/Uchikiri"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns. It also presents an interesting point of intermedia interest related to mode of delivery.</p>

  <p> At the conclusion of a spoken exchange during which Munechika  confirms that he accepts the imperial request, the young boy switches to non-congruent singing in <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin"><em>tsuyogin</em></a> mode, thus producing a serious and commanding tone, as he stands on his knee and dramatically announces that <time datetime='00:29:45.000' title='00:29:45'> he will return </time>. The change of mode of delivery combined with a raising motion highlight this important text, which links this shite with the one who will be coming in the second act.</p>
