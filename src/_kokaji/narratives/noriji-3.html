        <div class="section-introduction__definition">This is a descriptive <em>shōdan</em>. The jiutai acts as a narrator describing the action the audience is witnessing. Compared to a dance-to-text, this could be called a movements-to-text. Interestingly enough, the <em>shōdan</em> includes also some sound-to-text (onomatopea).	</div>

  <p> The point of intermedia interest of this <em>shōdan</em> focuses on movements that imitate the text, and text that imitates the movements with onomatopea.</p>

  <p>Conversely to the other two <em>noriji</em> this one is scored for two voices, the shite and jiutai, but this is not a dialogue, rather they are both acting as narrators, taking turns in describing the action. Text and <em>kata</em> are in perfect synchronicity in this <em>noriji</em>, where what is said is what is seen.</p>

  <p>The <em>noriji-3</em> is divided up into segments,  each one clearly articulated by the taiko’s rhythmic cycles, the beginning of each one identifiable by a head pattern <a href="/music/taiko/head"target="_blank"><em>kashira</em></a>:</p>

  <p>1- We are told that the deity is a young boy who ascends the forge mound before bowing to the waki. This formal introduction concludes the <em>noriji’s</em> introduction, in phase with the first taiko rhythmic cycle.</p>


  <p>2- During the next segment,  the deity asked Munechika to <time datetime='00:54:58.000' title='00:54:58'>bring the metal</time>
  to be forged into the blade, and he obliges. Then, the importance of the first three hammer strokes is underlined by the characters imitating the sound of the hammers on the blade with the onomatopea: ‘<em>chō</em>’ .</p>

  <p>3- Finally, the text highlights the magnificence of the event. As we hear that the <time datetime='00:55:54.000' title='00:55:54'>strokes are heard through heaven and earth</time>, the shite jumps out of the dais covers his head with his sleeves to indicate that he is no more physically present in this location. His Up-Left-Right-Down Head motion suggests that he can hear the sound of the strokes bouncing off through space. This is followed by the waki’s Left-Right Head motion which confirms that he can also hear it .</p>
