  <p>Musically, the <em>kakeai-2</em> is like a respite before the storm. Thus, for the span of three <em>honji</em>, the process of instrumental reduction  is carried on with the exit of the taiko and the change in the singing body from one singing voice and jiutai to two spoken voices. Also, the <em>kakeai</em> momentarily breaks the <em>honji’s</em> immutability and the synchronicity between beats and syllables. </p>

  <p>Story-wise, the <em>kakeai-2</em> is very much a continuation of the <em>noriji-3</em>, in fact even the synchronization between text and <em>kata</em> is carried on. Thus, we hear and see the two performers completing their work by engraving their respective <time datetime='00:56:17.000' title='00:56:17'> signature on the blade </time>.  The deity’s use of ‘<time datetime='00:56:29.000' title='00:56:29'> Little Fox </time>’ as his signature comes from the fact that foxes, often regarded as messengers are associated with various Inari shrines.</p>
