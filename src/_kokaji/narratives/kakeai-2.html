        <div class="section-introduction__definition">Munechika indicates that hearing of the legendary Chinese and Japanese swords has gladdened his heart. Yet he presses the young boy to reveal his identity. The latter evades the question by suggesting that Munechika should prepare his forge’s mount and waits for his return.

  <p>The <em>shōdan</em> marks a sharp return to one of the simplest textures: reciting voices with factual text accompanied by sparse <a href="/music/Otsuzumi&Kotsuzumi/Mitsuji"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns. It also presents an interesting point of intermedia interest related to mode of delivery.</p>

  <p> At the conclusion of a spoken exchange during which Munechika  confirms that he accepts the imperial request, the young boy raises on his knee and switches to non-congruent singing in <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin"><em>tsuyogin</em></a> mode, thus producing a serious and commanding tone, as he dramatically announces that <time datetime='00:29:45.000' title='00:29:45'>he will return</time>. The raising motion and change of mode of delivery have the effect of emphasizing the coinciding text: I will return, thus establishing a link between the young boy-shite of the first act with the very different deity-shite of the second act.</p>
