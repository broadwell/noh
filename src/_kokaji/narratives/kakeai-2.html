  <p>The Intermedia Index drops significantly. Musically the <em>kakeai-2</em> is like a moment of respite before a storm. For the span of three <em>honji</em>, there is no nohkan, taiko or jiutai. The chant is spoken by solo voices of shite and waki. The strict rhythmic synchronization of singing and instruments that was found in the preceding three <em>noriji</em> and will return in the next and last <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>kiri</em>, is temporarily interrupted. The percussion instruments are set in <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> rhythm following five and before the final <em>shōdan</em>, all in strict rhythm</p>
  <p>The <em>kakeai-2</em> is very much a continuation of the <em>noriji-3</em> in terms of coordination between text and <em>kata</em>. We hear and see the two performers completing the forging by engraving their respective <time datetime='00:56:17.000' title='00:56:17'> signatures on the blade </time>.</p>
