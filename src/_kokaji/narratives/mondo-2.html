<p>The intermedia interest of the scene comes from the use of stage space and text setting. </p><p> With waki standing on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 6</a> facing the shite, who at first is out of sight in the mirror room, the <time datetime='00:12:37.000' title='00:12:37'> widest possible distance </time> between them creates a unique dramatic effect.
Hearing but not seeing the shite helps the listeners share in Munechika's surprise, as he notices in consternation that "<em>... there is no path from the directon from which this unusual person has appeared.</em>"
To allow for the surprise 'appearance', the shite's is not introduced or accompanied by entrance music. Shite's first line is a call from the distance called  <em>yobikake</em>. The vowels are extended to give an impression that the mysterious voice is coming from afar. The prolongation of the vowels gradually tapers off as the shite reaches the stage.</p>

  <p>As the young boy finally reaches Square 1 and turns to face Munechika, there is a sudden change of tone and style during the last two lines of the <em>shōdan</em>. The actors switch to <time datetime='00:14:46.000' title='00:14:46'> non-congruent singing </time> to share a sentence; waki starting with "A voice in heaven" is conluded by shite's "echoes on the earth." The switch smoothens the transition to the next <em>shōdan</em>, whose poetic text is also sung. </p>
