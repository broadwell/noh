The shite who is heard yet invisible to Munechika as well as the audience, allows the listener to share Munechika's surpirse, as he notices in consternation that "<em>... there is no path from the directon from which this unusual person has appeared.</em>"

  <p> This <em>shōdan</em> has two points of intermedia interest related to the use of space and text setting.</p>

  <p> The shite's entrance intended as a surprise, is not introduced by any entrance music. Moreover, the shite who is meant to appear out of nowhere to the waki, is not even visible to the audience, delivering his first line from the mirror room, a call from the distance called  <em>yobikake</em>. The vowels of his first few lines are extended to give an impression that this uncanny voice is coming from the distance. The prolongation process of the vowels gradually tempers off as the shite reaches the stage.</p>

  <p> The dramatic tension created by the unexpected and otherworldly shite’s appearance is heightened by the fact that it opens up a dialogue between two actors separated by the <time datetime='00:12:37.000' title='00:12:37'> widest possible distance </time>, the shite making his way from the mirror room to the stage while the waki is standing on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares"target="_blank">Square 6</a>.</p>

  <p>As the shite who personifies a young boy, finally reaches Square 1 and turns to face Munechika, there is a sudden change of tone and style that smoothens the transition to the next <em>shōdan</em>, whose poetic text is  sung. Thus, the two performers switch to <time datetime='00:14:46.000' title='00:14:46'> non-congruent singing </time> to deliver the <em>shōdan’s</em> last two lines.</p>
