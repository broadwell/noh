  <p>The main feature of this <em>shōdan</em> is the shite’s grandiose entrance on the main stage supported by the full <em>hayashikata</em> and the jiutai, who speaks his words.</p>

<p>The <em>noriji-2</em> begins with an introduction that further delays the shite’s entrance on the main stage. Still standing at the First pine, the deity signals that he is about to <time datetime='00:52:30.000' title='00:52:30'>make his move</time> with a sequence of Six stamps, that he concludes with a Left Turn (now facing the stage) Forward Pointing, and its usual companion <em>kata</em>, the Open-retreat, leading to the nohkan’s <em>Takane hane</em> pattern, which concludes the introduction.</p>

<p>The deity finally <time datetime='00:52:50.000' title='00:52:50'>enters the stage</time> with a Large Zigzag performed in the dynamic Martial mode. At the conclusion of this <em>kata</em>, the deity faces Munechika as the jiutai intones "<em>utsubeki jisetsu wa kōku ni shireri</em>" (The appointed time for forging is known), pressing the waki to get started on his mission.</p>

<p>From this point on, the shite performs a sequence of <em>kata</em> that brings him to <time datetime='00:53:09.000' title='00:523:09'>Square 1</time>, where he concludes the <em>noriji-2</em> with the standard sequence: Forward Pointing and Open-retreat.</p>
