        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The <em>noriji-2</em> functions like an introduction to the dance. In fact, the <em>noriji</em> with its limited number of syllables and its immutable <em>honji</em> often leads to a dance, as it is the case here. The <em>hayashikata</em> is now complete and the shite has entered the Bridge. During this <em>shōdan</em>, he will enter the stage proper ready to perform the play’s dance, the <em>maibataraki</em>.

It speaks for the shite who is pressing Munechika to get started with the forging of the blade.

  <p>The main feature of this <em>shōdan</em> is the shite’s grandiose entrance on the main stage supported by the full <em>hayashikata</em> and the jiutai, who speaks his words.</p>

<p>The <em>noriji-2</em> begins with an introduction that further delays the shite’s entrance on the main stage. Still standing at the First pine, the deity signals that he is about to make his move with a sequence of Six stamps, that he concludes with a Left Turn (now facing the stage) Forward Pointing, and its usual companion <em>kata</em>, the Open-retreat, leading to the nohkan’s <em>Takane hane</em> pattern, which concludes the introduction.</p>

<p>The deity finally <time datetime='00:52:50.000' title='00:52:50'>enters the stage</time> with a Large Zigzag performed in the dynamic Male style. At the conclusion of this <em>kata</em>, the deity faces Munechika as the jiutai intones "<em>utsubeki jisetsu wa kōku ni shireri/The appointed time for forging is known</em>", pressing him to get started with his mission.</p>

<p>From this point on, the shite performs a sequence of <em>kata</em> that brings him to <time datetime='00:53:09.000' title='00:523:09'>Square 1</time>, where he concludes the <em>noriji-2</em> with the standard sequence: Forward Pointing and Open-retreat.</p>
