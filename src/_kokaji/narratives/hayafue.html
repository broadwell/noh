  <p>This extremely dynamic entrance music announces the arrival of a powerful being, a deity, in Kokaji’s case. The <em>hayafue</em> features a congruent nohkan part accompanied by the three percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting. This is the first <em>shōdan</em> in the second act with the full <em>hayashi</em>. The Intermedia Index has risen again.</p>

  <p>The melody begins with a one-<em>honji</em>- introduction that starts with the nohkan’s shrilling <a href="/music/nohkan/hishigi" target="_blank"><em>hishigi</em></a> pattern. Paired with the fast tempo, it creates a heroic tone that leads to the <em>Hayafue’s</em> melody which lasts seven <em>honji</em>. It is played two times and a half, before moving to its two-<em>honji</em> cadencing <em>tome</em pattern. </p>

  <p>It is at the very end of its second iteration that the curtain is lifted with a fast and energetic motion and shite makes his dramatic <time datetime='00:52:01.000' title='00:52:01'>entrance</time> onto the bridge. His left arm is stretched forward holding a hammer. He delays entering the stage proper however and first performs the standard sequence of <em>kata</em>: <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> and <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a> at the First pine. It is there that he stands at the conclusion of the <em>hayafue</em>, still holding the left arm stretched building anticipation that will be resolved at the beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>,  when he finally enters the stage proper. </p>
