An extremely dynamic entrance music announces the arrival of a powerful being, a deity in the Kokaji’s case.
  <p>The <em>hayafue</em> is a congruent nohkan solo accompanied by the three percussion instruments. Its entrance completes the <em>hayashigoto</em> in preparation for the upcoming dance.</p>


  <p>The melody begins with a one-<em>honji</em> long introduction that starts with the shrillingg <em>hishige</em> tone (notated in the score as'Hi'), which paired with the fast tempo,  provides the melody with a heroic tone. It lasts seven <em>honji</em>, and it is played two times and a half, before moving to its two-<em>honji</em>  cadencing <em>tome</em> pattern.</p>

  <p>It is at the very end of its second iteration that the shite makes his <time datetime='00:52:01.000' title='00:52:01'>entrance</time> on the bridge but delays entering the stage proper by performing a Forward pointing followed by an Open-retreat at the First pine where he stands at the conclusion of the <em>hayafue</em>, thereby creating a visual tension that will be resolved at the beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em> when he will finally enter the stage proper. </p>
