        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The <em>maibataraki</em> is a virile and animated dance well fitted for a shite incarnating  among others, dragon gods, goblins, or a deity as it is the case for Kokaji. Whereas the <em>kuse</em> and <em>kiri</em> are dance-to-text, the <em>maibataraki</em> is an instrumental dance, that is a dance without text, hence the relationship between music and dance is optimal in this <em>shōdan</em>.

<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">

  <p>The <em>maibataraki</em> has a three-layer structure: The nohkan provides a cyclical melodic background, and through its recurring patterns it articulates the dance’s three sections: <em>Kakari, Ji</em>, and <em>Dan</em>.
  The structure of this version of the <em>maibataraki</em> follows the nohkan’s, thus it is also divided into three sections: Opening up of the stage-space; Occupying center-stage; and Cadencing.</p><p>
  Throughout the dance, the three percussion instruments provide a pulsated background. The leading percussion instrument, the taiko uses its distinguishable head pattern <a href="/music/taiko-head" target="_blank"><em>kashira</em></a> to articulate the beginning and closing of its cycles, which are well synchronized with the nohkan’s part. Thus, nohkan and taiko parts help articulate the dance’s three sections.</p>

  <p>Kakari</p>

  <p>The <em>kakari</em> is spread over two <em>honji</em>, indentified in the sscore with the letters 'Ka'. It can be translated as ‘taking the time to perform something’, and in the case of the <em>maibataraki</em>, it is used to set the dance’s dynamic and upbeat mood.</p><p>
  Stamps are customarily performed by the shite at the beginning of a dance, as if calling the listener to attention. In the case of the <em>maibataraki</em>, it opens with a sequence of Six Stamps, each one in phase with one of the percussionists’ stroke, the first one also in phase with the very first note of the nohkan, which is playing in a congruent fashion for the second and last time in the play.</p>

  <p>Ji</p>

  <p>The function of the <em>Ji</em> section is twofold: Musically, it introduces of the nohkan’s <em>Ji</em> patterns, and spatially it corresponds to an opening of the stage-space.
  It is in this section that the nohkan introduces its core sequence of <time datetime='00:53:27.000' title='00:53:27'> three patterns </time> that we labelled: a, b, and c, each one lasting one <em>honji</em>. The <em>Ji</em> is played twice. Its performance coincides with the taiko’s first cycle of patterns clearly perceptible since it opens and closes with <em>kashira</em> patterns. </p>

  <p>Hence, it is against a clear temporal framework that the shite opens up the stage-space by traversing first the right lateral (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares"target="_blank">Square 1 to 3</a>), then the front stage (Square 3 to 5), and finally the left-right transversal (Square 5 to 8).
  This trajectory does not only open-up the stage-space, it also creates a spatial wave of tension-release. Indeed, backstage positions such as Squares 1 and 8, being further from the audience, are essentially positions of rest. They are often used as starting and closing positions for a dance and its various parts. On the other hand, frontstage positions such as Squares 3 and 4 and center-stage (Square 9), being closer to the audience, are essentially position of strength. Therefore, the motion Square 1 to 3 is building momentum since it brings the shite from a position of rest, (Square 1) to the front (Square 3). The motion Square 3 to 5 maintains momentum since he remains in the stage’s forefront. Finally, the motion (Square 5 to 8) releases tension, taking the shite from frontstage to backstage. </p>

  <p> It is interesting to note that the expansion of the stage-space in the <em>maibataraki</em> with its opening of the right lateral (Square 1 to 3), front stage (Square 3 to 5), and left-right transversal (Square 5 to Square 8) is identical to Hashitomi’s <em>jonomai’s</em> second section. </p>

  <p>Dan</p>

  <p>The temporal boundaries of the four-<em>honji dan</em>, the closing section of the dance, are once again clearly marked by the <em>hayashi</em>. The nohkan initiates it with <time datetime='00:53:50.000' title='00:53:50'>two new</time> one-<em>honji</em> patterns (that we labelled 'd', and 'e' in the score) followed by a return of its pattern ‘a’, leading to its cadential pattern <em>tome</em>.
  The <em>dan’s</em> four <em>honji</em> also coincide with the taiko’s second cycle, with its duration once again clearly articulated with <em>kashira</em> patterns.
  Finally, the taiko’s dropping out in the <em>dan’s</em> first <em>honji</em> creates a sudden change of density that helps delineate its beginning.</p>

  <p>During the <em>dan</em>, the shite occupies center-stage where he performs a <em><time datetime='00:53:46.000' title='00:53:46'>series of acrobatic kata</time></em> that reinforces his image of a powerful being: Two Large Steps and a Jump Kneel, followed by a Double Kneel, and a Flip Left Sleeve.
  This leads to a cadential phrase that brings him to the <time datetime='00:53:57.000' title='00:53:57'>front-stage</time> (Square 3) for the last time, where he performs a Right Circlet followed by a Circle back to Square 1, where he concludes the dance with an Open-retreat , a <em>kata</em> often used as a closing gesture.</p>
