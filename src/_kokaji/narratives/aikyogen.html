  <p>The ai-kyōgen in Kokaji starts with the actor's entrance over the continuing music of <em>raijo</em>. This and the fact that the actor wears a mask is somehwat rare and is dictated by the fact that the character he plays is diety. The rest of the interlude has a typically simple intermedia character. The ai-kyōgen recites with very little movement and mostly without music.</p>
      <p>Usually during the <em>nakairi</em>, the kyōgen actor engages in a discussion with the waki. But in Kokaji, the waki has exited the stage with the shite to prepare for a change of costume, thus the actor addresses the audience with a monologue standing on Square 1. In this case, the percussionists do not fold their chairs, rather they remain seated with their instruments neatly resting on the stage’s floor. Like the members of the jiutai, the four musicians have their hands in their pockets to show that although on stage, they are not part of the action.
