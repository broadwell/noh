      When a play is divided into two acts, the shite exits after the first one to change costumes and prepare for the second act. The time when the actor is off the stage is called <em>nakairi</em>. During this period, an interlude known as <em>aikyōgen</em> is performed on the stage. Typically, a kyōgen actor impersonating a local resident enters the stage and converses with the waki. In the process, he summarizes the first act and provides some basic information leading into the second one, as it is that case with Hashitomi. In this casse, it is typical for the hyōgen actor to kneel center-stage as he delivers his lines.</p>

      <p>Less often, both the shite and waki exit. Thus, the entering kyōgen actor delivers a monologue standing at Square 1. In this case, the percussionists do not fold their chair, rather they remain seated with their instruments neatly resting on the stage’s floor. Like the members of the jiutai, the four musicians have their hands in their pocket to show that although on stage, they are not part of the action.<br>
      This is the case with Kokaji, as the masked kyōgen actor impersonating a deity of a low-ranked Temple, summarizes the first act and expresses confidence in Munechika's abilities to complete that task at hand.</p>

      <p>Although less frequent, it is also possible for a kyōgen actor to appear within an act, in which case the <em>aikyōgen</em> is performed by a different actor. The play Kanawa is a good example, as it opens with the kyōgen actor, thus the <em>aikyōgen</em> is performed by the wakizure.</p>
