  <p> THIS PARAGRAPH WILL NEED TO END UP IN LEVEL 1: Following a sequence of unaccompanied <em>shōdan</em> delivered in spoken mode, the first <em>ageuta</em> with its accompanied poetic text came across as the closing highlight of the Waki enters section.  The situation is the same with the second <em>ageuta</em>, which itself follows three <em>shōdan</em> delivered in spoken mode. Its accompanied poetic text paired with the first dance movements make it the closing highlight of the Shite enters section.</p>

  <p> The <em>shōdan</em> concludes the Dialogue <em>dan</em>. It raises the Intermedia Index through the introduction of congruent singing accompanied by percussion. Also, the dramatic expression is hightened by the use of stage movement and <em>kata</em> to mark structural points aligned with musical changes, and mimetically reinforce the psychology of the narrative.</p>

    <p>The whole <em>shōdan</em> is chanted by the jiutai who serves as a narrator and gives voice to the boy. Munechika gradually gets accustomed to the boy's unexpected appearance as they turn toward each other at three structural points. First, they face each other at the beginning of the <em>shōdan</em> when Munechika notices the boy, then, at the conclusion of the first part, when the boy walks toward Munechika and hails the radiance of the Emperor's sword, and finally, at the end of the <em>shōdan</em>, when we hear that the forging order must be followed. The second part is marked also by the nohkan who joins with the <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane" target="_blank"><em>naka no takane</em></a> pattern, reinforcing the <time datetime='00:16:12.000' title='00:16:12'> enouragement</time> given to Munechika with words: <em>tada tonome kono kimi no</em>/"only have faith."</p>
