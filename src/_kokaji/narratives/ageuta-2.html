  <p> Following a sequence of unaccompanied <em>shōdan</em> delivered in spoken mode, the first <em>ageuta</em> with its accompanied poetic text came across as the closing highlight of the Waki enters section.  The situation is the same with the second <em>ageuta</em>, which itself follows three <em>shōdan</em> delivered in spoken mode. Its accompanied poetic text paired with the first dance movements make it the closing highlight of the Shite enters section.</p>

  <p> This <em>shōdan</em> has two points of intermedia interest related to the metric setting of text, and the interpretation of abstract <em>kata</em>.</p>

  <p> The <em>shōdan’s</em> poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> is entirely sung by the jiutai who speaks for the young boy. As it sings “<em>Nothing shall dim the radiance of the Emperor’s sword</em>”, a <a href="/music/voices/#TextSetting" target="_blank">four-beat measure</a> (<em>toriji</em>) is introduced, leading to a line of 8 + 5 syllables:“<em>Kumo no uebito no mitsurugi no/ The Emperor’s sword</em>”. The <em>toriji</em> adds four more beats for this line, far exceeding its needed thirteen syllable slots. Thus, a time gap delays the beginning of the line, thereby stressing the importance of its <time datetime='00:15:48.000' title='00:15:48'> text </time>. </p>

  <p>It is interesting to notice that the use of space also supports the text. At the beginning of the <em>ageuta</em> the two protagonists are apart and with little eye contact, symbolizing the psychological divide between the two. Starting on Square 1, the boy performs the <time datetime='00:15:37.000' title='00:15:37'> standard sequence </time> Forward Pointing and Open-retreat that takes him to Square 2, where after performing a Left Step Pivot he faces Munechika. In an effort, to befriend the swordsmith, he takes Three Steps toward him, bringing the two protagonists the closest this far in the play, just as the jiutai refers to the Emperor’s sword. This sequence of <em>kata</em> is used in all plays, yet it is the synchronization between text and movements that provides it with a meaning specific to this moment in the play. </p>

  <p> At the beginning of the <time datetime='00:16:12.000' title='00:16:12'> second part </time>, whose beginning is signaled by the nohkan’s <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane" target="_blank"><em>naka no takane</em></a> pattern, the biy, as if sensing that Munechika needs more time to befriend his presence,  moves away and circles back to Square 1, where he performs once again the same sequence of <em>kata</em>: Forward pointing, Open-retreat, and a Left Step Pivot, but this timne Munechika turns towards the youngg boy, acknowledging his presence. Thus, the boy takes One Step toward the swordsmith, as they once again stand facing each other, but now as allies.</p>
