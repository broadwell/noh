  <p>The first act opens right away in the medium range of the Intermedia Index. It feels as if we were picking up where we left off and continuing on a steady course of increasing activity even within the <em>shōdan</em> itself. All of the instruments are playing from the beginning, some with a regularity of pulse, gradually the waki joins and starts to perform mimetic movements, and eventually, to sing. </p>

  <p>The <em>notto</em> begins with a lively musical introduction alone. The percussion parts are in strict rhythmic setting. The kotsuzumi player sets the tone by playing the steady <em>notto uchitsume</em> pattern characterized by a stroke on each of the <em>honji’s</em> eight beats. Both the kotsuzumi pattern and the non-congruent nohkan’s part are exclusively used in the <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/notto-music" target="_blank"><em>notto</em>-music</a>.</p>

  <p>Munechika has been waiting in a kneeling position at <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 8</a>, facing diagonally away from the audience, as if absent. About half-way into the introduction music, he stands up and walks towards the <a href="/staging/props/#Kokaji" target="_blank"><em>dais</em></a> representing his forge, steps on it and kneels. Picking up a sacred wand with the right hand, he performs a purifying ritual. The text of the <em>notto</em>-chant, set in non-congruent <a href="/music/voices/#Sashinori" target= "_blank"<em>sashinori</em></a> is loosely synchornized with the accompaniment by fitting its lines between the  <a href="/music/otsuzumi-sounds" target="_blank"><em>chon</em></a> strokes of the ōtsuzumi. These fall on <em>honji’s</em> third beat and are preceded by a slight slowdown and an extended kakegoe. Longer lines that do not fit within the eight-beat span of the successive <em>chon</em> strokes, are spread over three or four <em>honji</em>. In this case, there is no rallentando leading to the intermediate <em>chon</em> stroke(s). During the intermediate <em>honji</em>  the ōtsuzumi performs a sequence of four, five, or six <em>chon</em> strokes <time datetime='00:47:23.000' title='00:47:23'> that maintain the momentum</time>.</p>

  <p>The waki begins to sing. From time to time the chant slows down to emphasize selected words. This happens for instance, when Munechika acknowledges that his craft came to him through <time datetime='00:47:08.000' title='00:47:08'> no effort of his own</time> with the line ‘<em>chikara ni arazu</em>. The emphasis can also be done by a combination of rhythm and pitch. When Munechika raises the wand and prays for divine assistance in the completion his task the line lasts three <em>honji</em>  and its syllables are spread as to create a rallentando on the words: “<time datetime='00:46:29.000' title='00:46:29'>...I make my petition</time>”. The stress on the keyword ‘<em>sasage</em>’ is emphasized when Munechika interrupts his steady tone with a raising of pitch followed by a descending glissando. It can be perceived as an expression of commitment to the fulfillment of the imperial order. </p>
