  <p>During the <em>notto</em>-music, Munechika is kneeling on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares"target="_blank">Square 8</a>, facing backward. About half-way in, he stands up and walks towards the dais, steps on it and kneels. Picking up a sacred wand with his right hand, he performs a purifying ritual as he regains faith in his craftmanship. The text of the <em>notto</em>-chant, set in <em>sashinori</em>, includes sixteen lines.</p>

  <p>Although the chant and its rhythmic accompaniment are not synchronized through the beats, they are nonetheless connected. Three observations can be made about the interaction between the text and the percussion patterns:</p>

  <p>1- While the kotsuzumi is performing its periodic <em>notto uchi tsume</em> pattern characterized by a stroke of each of the <em>honji’s</em> eight beats, the ōtsuzumi player uses his <em>kakegoe</em> to control rallentandi leading to the <em>honji’s</em> third beat where he performs a <a href="/music/otsuzumi-sounds" target="_blank"><em>chon</em></a> stroke.<br>
  For the most part, a complete line of text fits within the eight beats that separate two consecutive <em>chon</em> strokes, as it is the case for the <em>notto’s</em> <time datetime='00:45:56.000' title='00:45:56'>first three lines</time>. Indeed, having completed a sentence with a sustained-tone, the waki uses the next <em>chon</em> stroke as a reference for positioning his next line, which often starts around the <em>honji's</em> fifth beat.<br>
  Longer lines that do not fit within the eight beats span between two successive <em>chon</em> strokes are spread over three or four consecutive <em>chon</em> strokes. In this case, there is no rallentando leading to the intermediate <em>chon</em> stroke(s). Moreover, during in intermediate <em>honji</em> the ōtsuzumi performs a sequence of four, five, or six <em>chon</em> strokes that <time datetime='00:47:23.000' title='00:47:23'>maintains the momentum</time>.</p>

  <p>2- For the most part, the syllables between two <em>chon</em> strokes are spread more or less evenly before leading to a sustained-tone. Sometimes though, the rhythmic distribution of the syllables is uneven, mixing faster and slower durations, where the latter help bring to focus certain keywords. For instance, humility is a highly praise virtu in Japan, as illustrated by Munechika who acknowledges that his craft came to him through “<time datetime='00:47:08.000' title='00:47:08'>no effort of my own</time>”. This  is highlighted in the corresponding line with a rhythmic slowdown on ‘<em>chikara ni arazu</em>’ from the sentence: “<em>Kore watakushi no chikara ni arazu</em>”.</p>

  <p>3 - The performance of the fourth line provides an example of how pitch can be combined to rhythm to also emphasize keywords. It is at the conclusion of the fourth line that Munechika announces forcefully, as he is raising the Sacred wand, that he is making his petition, in other words that he is calling for divine assistance for the completion his task.
  This line lasts three <em>honji</em> and its syllables have been spread as to create a rallentando on the words: “<time datetime='00:46:29.000' title='00:46:29'>...I make my petition</time>”. The stress on the keyword ‘<em>sasage</em>’ from the line “<em>shi-hō ni honzon no kake-tatematsuri heihaku wo sasage</em>” is further emphasized by Munechika interrupting his repeated tone with a change of pitch followed by a descending glissando that produces a forceful tone, heard as an expression of commitment towards the fulfillment of the imperial request.</p>
