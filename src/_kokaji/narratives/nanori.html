        <div class="section-introduction__definition">Having walked through the bridge at a moderately fast but calm pace, the wakizure dressed in courtier’s costume stands on a humble and quiet stage position (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a>) to deliver his lines. The stage may represent the Imperial Palace where the wakizure starts his journey or somewhere on the way to Kyoto where Munechika lives. He then walks back onto the bridge toward the First Pine. </div>

  <p>The silent entrance followed by almost no movement and unaccompanied recitation represents very simple intermedia expression. It is a common starting point in a Noh play's development and its first energetic arc. Entrance music is usually performed for the entrance of a priest, goddess, deity, dragon, and the like. The Emperor's envoy is of lesser rank and a secondary role performed by a wakizure so his <time datetime='00:03:06' title='00:03:06.000'> entrance </time>is done without accompaniment and at a relatively inconspicuous moderately fast speed.</p>
  <p>The envoy's introduction and explanation of intentions are done in a simple and sparse way. There is no musical accompaniment, the speech using a more common sanbun language is simple and steady and there is practically no movement while he remains in a very calm position on Square 1.
</p>

  <p>The envoy concludes the <em>nanori</em> by bringing his <time datetime='00:04:50.000' title='00:04:50'> hands together</time>, holding a fan in his right one. While the origin of the gesture is believed to be related to prayer, it has become a standard closing gesture used by secular and religious characters alike, such as the <a href="/hashitomi/nanori/#startTime=00:06:25" target="_blank">monk</a> in Hashitomi.</p>
