  <p>Entrance music is usually performed for the entrance of a priest, goddess, deity, dragon, and the like. The waki-tsure being an Emperor envoy, he enters the stage <time datetime='00:03:06' title='00:03:06.000'> without any accompaniment </time>.</p>

  <p>After arriving at Square 1, the humblest and quietest stage position, the waki-sture delivers the <em>nanori</em>. It is composed of six lines delivered in <em>kotoba</em>. The text is factual, we learn that he is at the service of Emperor Ichijo, who had a dream oracle suggesting that he gets a blade forged by the swordsmith Munechika, whose house he is now heading to. </p>

  <p>The waki-tsure concludes the <em>nanori</em> by bringing his <time datetime='00:04:50.000' title='00:04:50'> hands together </time>, holding a fan in his right one . While the origin of the gesture is believed to be related to prayer, it has become a standard closing gesture used by secular and religious characters alike, such as the monk in Hashitomi.</p>
