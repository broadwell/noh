  <p>The silent entrance followed by almost no movement and unaccompanied recitation represents very simple intermedia expression. It is a common starting point in a Noh play's development and its first energetic arc. Entrance music is usually performed for the entrance of a priest, goddess, deity, dragon, and the like. The Emperor's envoy is of lesser rank and a secondary role performed by a wakizure so his <time datetime='00:03:06' title='00:03:06.000'> entrance </time>is done without accompaniment and at a relatively inconspicuous moderately fast speed.</p>
  <p>The envoy's introduction and explanation of intentions are done in a simple and sparse way. There is no musical accompaniment, the speech using a more common sanbun language is simple and steady and there is practically no movement while he remains in a very calm position on Square 1.
</p>

  <p>The envoy concludes the <em>nanori</em> by bringing his <time datetime='00:04:50.000' title='00:04:50'> hands together</time>, holding a fan in his right one. While the origin of the gesture is believed to be related to prayer, it has become a standard closing gesture used by secular and religious characters alike, such as the <a href="/hashitomi/nanori/#startTime=00:06:25" target="_blank">monk</a> in Hashitomi.</p>
