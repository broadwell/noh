  <p> In clear contrast with the preceding <em>ageuta</em>, the <em>raijo</em> is <time datetime='00:31:20.000' title='00:31:20'>non-congruent</time> during the exit of the two protagonists, but  <time datetime='00:34:12.000' title='00:34:12'>congruent</time> during the kyōgen’s entrance.  The shite is the first one to exit is followed by the waki who does not enter the bridge until the shite has exited. Moreover, the kyōgen does not enter the stage until the waki’s exit has been concluded by a closed curtain.</p>

  <p>The featured instrument in the <em>raijo</em> is the nohkan, accompanied by the three percussion instruments whose respective rhythmic patterns merge into a single macro-rhythmic pattern.
  Since it is not possible to predict how long the exit and entrance will last, musicians follow the <em>mihakarai</em> principle. This is a concept of flexibility that allows the number of repetitions to be determined by the action on stage. In this case, it is determined by the time the actors need to exit and enter the stage. The taiko player who sits in front of the bridge, uses his <em>kakegoe</em> to communicate the changes to the other musicians.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the <em>raijo</em>, the shite takes <time datetime='00:31:20.000' title='00:31:20'>three special footsteps</time>, each one performed solemnly, separated from the next one by eight beats. Each step symbolizes the shite traveling a long distance at a very fast speed. After the third step, the shite walks out in standard fashion.</p>
