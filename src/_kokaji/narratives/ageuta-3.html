  <p>All the <em>kata</em> performed in the <em>shōdan</em> are standard ones, yet context provide them with meaning.</p>

  <p> The first sentence of an <em>ageuta</em> is typically repeated. In this case, the jiutai who speaks for the young boy, sings twice the following line:“<em>I will change into supernatural form.</em>”, but the first time, the boy kneeling center-stage faces front, hence addressing the <time datetime='00:30:06.000' title='00:30:06'>audience</time>, but for the repetition, he slides left to engage <time datetime='00:30:14.000' title='00:30:14'>Munechika</time>.</p>

  <p>Context provides the next three standard <em>kata</em> with a ceremonial tone. As the jiutai still speaking for the young boy tells that he will come back and join forces with the swordsmith, the boy stands up and faces Munechika, as he performs a Forward Pointing followed by an Open-retreat, two <em>kata</em> that visually reinforce his commitment. The swordsmith replies by <time datetime='00:30:24.000' title='00:30:24'>ceremoniously bowing</time>. In doing so, he confirms for the first time in the drama, that he now understands and accepts their hierarchical relationship: the helping deity, and the helped swordsmith.</p>

  <p>Then, as the jiutai refers to the clouds of Mount Inari, <time datetime='00:30:46.000' title='00:30:46'>the tempo suddenly picks up</time>. In preparation for his imminent departure into the Inari sky, the boy builds tension by moving to the very dynamic Square 3, where he circles and faces the waki. Then he releases the tension by going to Square 1 where he performs a Circlet point, to symbolize his disappearance, which is confirmed by Munechika, who slides right to face front and points forward where we deduce the boy just vanished. For the audience, the boy performs an Open-retreat as a closing <em>kata</em> before starting his exit.</p>

  <p>When this <em>ageuta</em> is not followed by the exit music <em>raijo</em>, the nohkan player concludes it with a <em>Takane</em> pattern.
  But when followed by the exit/entrance music <em>raijo</em> as it is the case in this version, the <em>Takane</em> is replaced with the <em>Hishigi</em> pattern, whose beginning <time datetime='00:30:59.000' title='00:30:59'>overlaps</time> with the end of the <em>ageuta</em> and the beginning of the <em>raijo</em>.</p>
