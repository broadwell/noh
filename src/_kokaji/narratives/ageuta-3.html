  <p>The <em>shōdan</em> is a highest Intermedia Index point of the Shite Exits <em>dan</em>. The congruent setting of jiutai chant accompanied by percussion in strict rhythm, and the typical for <em>ageuta</em> repeated first line, give weight to the commitment made by the deity. The significant acceleration and the brief but very energetic sequence of kata in the second half of the <em>shōdan</em> fit well a young boy but speak also to the diety's strength.</p>

  <p>All the <em>kata</em> performed in the <em>shōdan</em> are structural but the text and context provide them with additional meaning. As we hear the diety say (chanted by the jiutai) that "I will come without fail, at the appointed time"<time datetime='00:30:24.000' title='00:30:24'>Munechika</time> the boy stands up and facing Munechika performs a Forward Pointing followed by an Open-retreat, two standard <em>kata</em> that here visually reinforce his commitment. The swordsmith replies by <time datetime='00:30:24.000' title='00:30:24'>ceremoniously bowing</time>.</p>

  <p>Then, as the jiutai refers to the clouds of Mount Inari, <time datetime='00:30:46.000' title='00:30:46'>the tempo suddenly picks up</time>. In preparation for his imminent departure into the sky, the boy builds tension by moving to the very dynamic Square 3, where he circles and faces the waki. Then he releases the tension by going to Square 1 where he performs a Circlet point. This symbolizes his disappearance, which is confirmed by Munechika, who slides right to face front and points forward where we deduce the boy just vanished.</p>

  <p>DO WE NEED THIS? HERE? When this <em>ageuta</em> is not followed by the exit music <em>raijo</em>, the nohkan player concludes it with a <em>Takane</em> pattern.
  But when followed by the exit/entrance music <em>raijo</em> as it is the case in this version, the <em>Takane</em> is replaced with the <em>Hishigi</em> pattern, whose beginning <time datetime='00:30:59.000' title='00:30:59'>overlaps</time> with the end of the <em>ageuta</em> and the beginning of the <em>raijo</em>.</p>

            <p>Like the <em>kuse</em> and <em>kiri</em>, it is when narrative becomes more important than poetry, that the text moves from regular to irregular rhythm. While the text of most <em>ageuta</em> is regular, Kokaji's <em>Ageuta 3</em> narrates the dramatic departure of the diety, thus its irregular rhythm (5+5, 5+6, 4+6, 6+6, 7+6, 5+5, 7+5, 7+5).</p>
