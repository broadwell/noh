<p>Oshirabe is a short musical piece that is heared before a play. The musicians perform it in the anteroom separated from the audience by the lowered curtain. It announces that the performance is about to begin and establishes the expressive character of the play. It offers a transition from everyday life to the magic of theater. </p>
    <p>Oshirabe means ‘to tune,’ and it refers to the musicians adjusting their instruments. As such, it is not considered an actual section of a play. The tuning is needed because each percussion instrument is reassembled right before the performance, and no sound-making is allowed while in the back of the stage. It is the musicians' first opportunity to hear and adjust their instruments. The tuning does not involve attempts to match one another's pitch. Rather they are attuning to the play’s <em>kurai</em>, or its overall atmosphere. Because all oshirabe consist of the same musical material it is its unique expressive inflection that a regular audience member can pick up on. After finishing, the musicians bow to each other reinforcing their unity as a group.</p>

    <p>Oshirabe exemplifies the power of intermedia 'absence'. In the spirit of slow and gradual development that is prevalent in Noh, the rich spectacle begins with only instruments sounding from behind a curtain. There are no vocal sounds, and the percussionists do not yet utter kakegoe. Music made invisibly is at its most fleeting. The audience is offered a mere ‘ghost’ of what is about to happen. The void intensifies the anticipation. As the viewers fall into silence they can appreciate the visual aspects of the stage tinged by the musically evoked <em>kurai</em>. </p>
