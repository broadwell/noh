  <p><em>Oshirabe</em> is a short musical piece that is heard before a play. The musicians perform it in the anteroom separated from the audience by the lowered curtain. It announces that the performance is about to begin and establishes the expressive character of the play. It offers a transition from everyday life to the art of theater. </p>
  <p>Oshirabe means ‘to tune,’ and it refers to the musicians adjusting their instruments. As such, it is not considered an actual module of a play.
  The tuning and warm-up are needed because each percussion instrument is reassembled right before a performance, and no sound-making is allowed in the back of the stage. It is the musicians' first opportunity to hear and adjust their instruments. The tuning does not involve attempts to match one another's pitch. Instead, they are attuning to the play’s <em>kurai</em>, or its overall atmosphere. Because all <em>oshirabe</em> consist of the same musical material, it is its unique, expressive inflection that a regular audience member can pick up on. After finishing, the musicians bow to each other reinforcing their unity as a group and walk onto the stage.</p>

<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">

<p><em>Oshirabe</em> exemplifies the expressive use of intermedia in their minimum. The spectacle that will eventually involve a richness of elements begins with music sounding from behind the curtain. Only the instruments are playing, gradually being introduced from the nohkan alone to the whole ensemble. There is no singing, and the percussionists do not yet utter kakegoe. After a minute or two playing together they stop playing in reverse order. Music performed invisibly is at its most fleeting. The audience is offered a mere ‘ghost’ of it. The absence of other elements intensifies the anticipation. As the viewers fall into silence, they get to appreciate the visual aspects of the stage in the atmosphere evoked by the music. This beginning is an extreme starting point for a slow and gradual intermedia development that is the essence of a Noh play. </p>
