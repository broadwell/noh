  <p>The <em>kuri</em> marks an important turning point in the story, as Munechika is taken through a confidence building process, as seen in the text which celebrates the power of two Chinese Emperors and their glorious sword.
  The non-congruent chant is delivered by the jiutai who speaks for the young boy. It starts with a reference to Liu Bang (256 – 195 BC), the founding Emperor of the Han dynasty. It is said that shortly before dying he exclaimed that “wielding a three-foot sword, as a commoner I conquered the world.” It is followed by a reference to Yang Jian (541 – 604 AD) the first Emperor of the Sui Dynasty and his sword Kei who defeated the House of Chou.</p>

  <p>The <em>kuri’s</em> fast and upbeat music is well suited to set this new tone. Moreover, the light singing mode <em>yowagin</em> is from this point on replaced with the heavier <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin"target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a>, which is commonly used to express bravery and excitement.</p>

  <p> The point of intermedia interest of this <em>shōdan</em> focuses on how space and <em>kata</em> can convey meaning despite being abstract components.</p>

  <p> At the very beginning of the <em>shōdan</em>, the young boy moves from <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares"target="_blank">Square 1</a> to center stage via Square 8, where he kneels facing front. This act of shortening the physical stage distance between him and Munechika symbolizes that the psychological divide between them is dwindling.</p>

  <p>Then, shortly after the introduction of the nohkan’s <em>yuri</em> pattern, the young boy slides left making eye contact with Munechika, underlining the fact that the jiutai is speaking for the former and that this <time datetime='00:17:21.000' title='00:17:21'> allocution </time> is indeed addressed to the latter. As the <em>shōdan</em> is ending, the young boy slides back to face front as he prepares to engage the audience at the beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>.</p>
