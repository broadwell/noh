  <p>The <em>kuri</em> marks an important turning point in the story, as Munechika is taken through a confidence building process(??? - IS IT FOR MUNECHIKA), as seen in the text which celebrates the power of two Chinese Emperors and their glorious swords.
  The jiutai speaks for the young boy (ARE WE SURE???). </p>
  <p>WHERE DOES THIS GO???It starts with a reference to Liu Bang (256 – 195 BC), the founding Emperor of the Han dynasty. It is said that shortly before dying he exclaimed that “wielding a three-foot sword, as a commoner I conquered the world.” It is followed by a reference to Yang Jian (541 – 604 AD) the first Emperor of the Sui Dynasty and his sword Kei who defeated the House of Chou.</p>

  <p>The Intermedia Index dips down as the chant in non-congruent setting is performed by the jiutai with both actors kneeling statically throughout and only turning toward each other for the concluding line.</p

  ><p>However, the <em>kuri’s</em> fast and upbeat music featuring the percussion and the nohkan is well suited to set a new tone for the recount of imperial triumphs. Appropriately, the light singing mode <em>yowagin</em> is from this point on replaced with the heavier <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin"target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a>, which is commonly used to express bravery and excitement.</p>

  <p>When at the beginning of the <em>shōdan</em>, the young boy moves from <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares"target="_blank">Square 1</a> to center stage, the closer proximity of the two characters and their synchronized kneeling down can imply a building of trust. The feeling is reinforced at the end when they turn to face each other.</p>
