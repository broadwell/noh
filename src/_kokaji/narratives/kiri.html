        <div class="section-introduction__definition">A dance-to-text of the shite using most of the stage. The shite takes the blade, performs a few <em>kata</em> holding it prominently then brings it to the envoy while the waki watches them. The envoy accepts, the shite bows and performs a short sequence of <em>kata</em> ending with a rapid walk onto the bridge stopping at the Second Pine where he mimes his disappearance.

<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <p>The final <em>shōdan</em> of the play involves active dance, congruent singing, strict percussion and striking closing notes of the nohkan. This brings the Intermedia Index to its second highest point. The mimetic movement matches the text, and the fast and intense music underlines the climactic character of the section. </p>

  <p>The <em>kiri</em> can be divided into three parts: introduction of the sword as 'Clustering Clouds of Heaven', boasting of its powers as it is offered to the envoy, and the deity’s exit. To proclaim the name of the sword with emphasis, a four-beat <em>toriji</em> measure is inserted. It interrupts the steady flow of <em>honji</em> and allows to precede the name “<em>Ama no murakumo…</em>” (<time datetime='00:56:57.000' title='00:56:57'>Clustering Clouds of Heaven...</time>)” with a pause. The sword is demonstrated proudly by the deity by performing the standard cadential sequence of Forward pointing and Open-retreat but while holding the blade.</p>

    <p>Second part begins with the deity looking at the sword held between stretched arms and <time datetime='00:57:11.000' title='00:57:11'>pronouncing: 'First under heaven'</time>. After repeating the claim the jiutai tells about the protection and blessings that the sword will bring. The dance’s momentum picks up and it will not abate until the end of the <em>kiri</em>. The shite starts by reinforcing the statements with a series of powerful <time datetime='00:57:19.000' title='00:57:19'>Six and Seven Stamps</time>, producing also a dynamic counterpoint with the melodic line. The symbolic <time datetime='00:57:40.000' title='00:57:40'>Pointing and Large Circle </time>, that follows is loosely synchronized with the text that speaks of ruling the land to the four seas and abundance of the five staple crops. As the jiutai sings “<em>Inari no shintai Kogitsune-maru wo/The manifestation of Inari: the Little Fox</em>”, the shite prepares to formally deliver the blade by performing an <time datetime='00:57:52.000' title='00:57:52'>Open-retreat</time> that brings him back to Square 1. In a moment filled with intensity, the deity holding the sword with two hands, walks forward to the Emperor's envoy, hands it to him, and moves back to Kneel and Bow.</p>

  <p>The final section of the text starts with "<em> kore made nari to ii-sutete/Now, I am done!</em>", and brings a change of tone created by a <time datetime='00:58:07.000' title='00:58:07'>sudden spike in tempo</time> of both music and dance. The deity stands up and performs several virtuosic <em>kata</em> with spectacular agility. <time datetime='00:58:15.000' title='00:58:15'> Two Large Steps, Leap Turn and a sequence of Kneeling </time> mimics the words “<em>mata mura-kumo ni tobi-nori/he leaps upon the mass of clouds</em>.
    The closing nohkan’s <em>tome no te</em> pattern confirms the finality of the situation as the deity moves with determination to the 2nd Pine on the Bridge. It again takes <time datetime='00:58:26.000' title='00:58:26'>two Large Steps </time> in preparation for a Leap Turn, illustrating his return to Mt. Inari, over the words “<em>Higashiyama Inari no mine ni zo kaerikeru/and returns to the Eastern Peak of Mt. Inari!</em>. Finally, the deity flips the Left sleeve to cover the head to indicate disappearance from view. Munechika turns toward him as if seeing the diety off.</p>
