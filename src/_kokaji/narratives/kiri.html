Part I introduces the signed sword as 'Clustering Clouds of Heaven'.
Part II tells about the power of the blade as the shite prepares to take his leave.

  <p>The relationship between <em>kata</em> and text, where movements provide a visualization of the text, is the <em>kiri’s</em> main intermedia feature, as it was in the other danced to text <em>ssh1odan</em>, the <em>kuse</em>.</p>

  <p>Part-I</p>

  <p>The Part-I is short. The words ‘Clustering Clouds of Heaven’, which refer to the two protagonists’ signatures on the blade, symbolizes the completion of the work.
    This is clearly stated in the chant with the insertion of the four-beat measure (<em>toriji</em>) that allows for a pause leading to, thus emphasizing the text: “<em>Ama no murakumo…</em>” (<time datetime='00:56:57.000' title='00:56:57'>Clustering Clouds of Heaven...</time>)”.
    The Part-I sense of closure is confirmed by the deity who performs a Right Large Circle that releases tension taking him from front- to back-stage (Square 8), where he performs the standard sequence Forward pointing and Open-retreat.</p>

    <p>Part-II</p>

    <p>Part-II begins with the <time datetime='00:57:11.000' title='00:57:11'>deity’s solo line</time> as he stares at the sword that he is holding at arm’s length. The text tells about the protection and blessings the sword will bring. The dance’s momentum picks up immediately after this  line, and it will not abate until the end of the <em>kiri</em>.
    The next two lines of the jiutai are accompanied by a series of <time datetime='00:57:19.000' title='00:57:19'>Six and Seven Stamps</time>, producing a dynamic counterpoint with the melodic line. The stamps loosely synchronized with the text " <em>Ten-ga dai-ichi no</em>” (First under Heaven) symbolize the power of the blade. The <time datetime='00:57:34.000' title='00:57:34'>Double sweep with the Flipped Left Sleeve</time>, that follows loosely synchronized with "<em>shi-kai wo osame tamaeba</em>” (It will rule the land to the four seas), symbolizes the four seas.
    This is followed by a medium Circling to the right that brings him to Square 1 where he rebuilds momentum by performing a Body turn combined with a Scooping point (57:42).
    As the members of the jiutai are singing “<em>Inari no shintai Kogitsune-maru wo</em>” (The manifestation of Inari: the Little Fox), the shite prepares to deliver the blade by performing an <time datetime='00:57:48.000' title='00:57:48'>Open-retreat</time>
    that brings him back to Square 1.
    In a moment filled with intensity, the deity holding the sword with two hands,  takes twelve steps to Square 5 where he handles it to the Emperor’s envoy. After having taken six steps back, he Kneels and Bows to the envoy.</p>

    <p>Part-III</p>

    <p>The last section of the text starts with "<em> kore made nari to ii-sutete</em>" (Now, I am done!), announcing not only the forthcoming shite’s exit, but also that the text is now switching to reality.
    This change of tone is further emphasized by a <time datetime='00:58:07.000' title='00:58:07'>sudden spike in tempo</time>. At this point, the deity stands up, performs a Forward pointing, and rushes to strong Square 4 where he performs a Full circlet that brings him back to Square 9 .
    Then, he takes two large steps in preparation for a spectacular Leap turn to the left followed with a <time datetime='00:58:18.000' title='00:58:18'> sequence of Kneeling </time>that mimics the words“<em>mata mura-kumo ni tobi-nori</em> (he leaps upon the mass of clouds).
    The cadential nohkan’s <em>tome no te</em> pattern confirms the imminent end of the play, yet it is with the undeterred determination that the deity moves to the 2nd Pine of the Bridge where he again takes <time datetime='00:58:26.000' title='00:58:26'>two Large Steps in preparation for a Leap turn to the right</time> mimicking his return to Mt. Inari, over the words “<em>Higashiyama Inari no mine ni zo kaerikeru</em> (and returns to the Eastern Peak of Mt. Inari!).
    Finally, he uses his Left sleeve to cover his head to indicate that he is no more physically present in this location.</p>
