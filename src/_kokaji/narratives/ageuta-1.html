        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The focus temporarily moves from reality to Munechika’s inner thoughts.
The module (<em>shōdan</em>) is divided into two parts: First: Munechika kneeling with his head down in deference to emperor’s envoy is full of hesitation. Second: Munechika resolves to pray for divine help so that he can successfully fulfill the Emperor’s request.

  <p> This <em>shōdan</em> has two points of intermedia interest related to text setting and the use of space.</p>

  <p>The first <em>ageuta</em> is the third and last <em>shōdan</em> of the “Waki Enters” section, and it is its high-point. It corresponds to an expansion of the musical texture, with the first entrance of the jiutai, the two hand-percussion instruments and the nohkan, and also and expansion of the use of stage-space, with both actors moving from the bridge to the main stage.</p>

  <p>This <em>shōdan</em> differs from the preceding two with its text setting. Up to this point, the text delivered in a spoken fashion, introduced factual information, but for the span of the <em>ageuta</em>, the focus switches to the Munechika’s inner feelings expressed in sung poetry. Most of Kokaji’s chants are sung in the strong <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin"target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a> mode, except for the two <em>agueta</em>, both carrying Munechika’s expression of hesitation and self-doubt, both sang in the softer <a href="/music/voices#Yowagin"target="_blank"><em>yowagin</em></a> mode .</p>

  <p>Questions of identity are at the heart of most Noh plays whose plot unfolds around the shite’s identity. Transfer of identity is also a common trend in Noh, an example of which is found at the beginning of this <em>ageuta</em>. Typically, the first line of text of an <em>ageuta’s</em> is repeated. Here, the <em>ageuta’s</em> first line is delivered by Munechika, repeated by the jiutai. Thus, by repeating his line, the jiutai becomes Munechika's voice, sharing his inner feelings with the audience.  Yet, the initial line and its repetition are not sequential, but separated by an <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri"target="_blank"><em>uchikiri</em></a> during which the nohkan performs its <a href="/music/nohkan/takane"target="_blank"><em>takane</em></a> pattern, as if time had been suspended to allow for this transfer of identity.</p>

  <p>The return of the nohkan, who had been silent since performing the <em>takane</em> pattern, marks the beginning of the <time datetime='00:09:54.000' title='00:09:54'>second part</time>. Its beginning is also articulated by the change of text setting, a shift that reflects the Munechika's changing mind set. Thus, the declamatory <a href="/music/voices/#Mitsuji-utai"target="_blank"><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a>  used in the first part to express Munechika's self-doubting feeling, is replaced in the second part with the steady <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-utai" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a>, used to express his faith in divine help.</p>

  <p>The <em>ageuta</em> corresponds also to the first expansion of the use of stage space. Up to this point, it had been limited to the Bridge and Square 1, but as the jiutai carries the chant, both characters walk from the bridge to the stage.</p>

  <p>Closer to the beginning of the <em>shōdan’s</em> second part, the envoy kneels at Square 5, the traditional position for a secondary actor, while Munechika stops center-stage, at Square 9 turns and kneels facing the audience. By occupying the strong central position, one usually reserved to the shite, we understand that Munechika’s story is now taking ‘center stage’.</p>
