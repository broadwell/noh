  <p>The third <em>shōdan</em> of the “Waki Enters” section is its high-point. It corresponds to an expansion of the musical texture, with the first entrance of the jiutai, the two percussion instruments and the nohkan, and also an increase in the use of stage-space, with both actors moving from the bridge to the main stage.</p>

  <p>The <em>shōdan</em> differs from the preceding two with its text setting. Up to this point, the text delivered in a spoken fashion, introduced factual information, but for the span of the <em>ageuta</em>, the focus switches to the Munechika’s inner feelings expressed in sung poetry. Most of Kokaji’s chants are sung in the strong <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin"target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a> mode, except for the two <em>ageuta</em>, both carrying Munechika’s expression of hesitation and self-doubt, which are sung in the more lyrical <a href="/music/voices#Yowagin"target="_blank"><em>yowagin</em></a> style.</p>

  <p>Typically, the first line of text of an <em>ageuta’s</em> is repeated. Here, the line is first delivered by Munechika and repeated by the jiutai. Thus, by the restatment, the jiutai becomes Munechika's voice, sharing his inner feelings with the audience.  The initial line and its repetition are  separated by an <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri"target="_blank"><em>uchikiri</em></a> during which the nohkan performs a <a href="/music/nohkan/takane"target="_blank"><em>takane</em></a> pattern, as if to carry through the transfer of identity.</p>

  <p>A later return of the nohkan, who had been silent since the <em>uchikiri</em> contributes to an <time datetime='00:09:54.000' title='00:09:54'>expressive shift</time> in text setting that reflects the Munechika's changing mindset. The declamatory <a href="/music/voices/#Mitsuji-utai"target="_blank"><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a>  used in the first part to express Munechika's self-doubting feeling, is replaced with the steady <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-utai" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a>, to express his faith in divine help.</p>

  <p>The <em>ageuta</em> corresponds also to the first expansion of the use of stage space. Up to this point, it had been limited to the Bridge and Square 1, but as the jiutai carries the chant, both characters walk from the bridge to the stage.</p>

  <p>Closer to the beginning of the <em>shōdan’s</em> second part, the envoy kneels at Square 5, the traditional position for a secondary actor, while Munechika stops center-stage, at Square 9 turns and kneels facing the audience. By occupying the strong central position, one usually reserved to the shite, we understand that Munechika’s role is of greater importance than most waki's.</p>
