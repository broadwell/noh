    <h2>Elements of Music: an Introduction</h2>

    <p>Noh as a form of musical theater which features actors singing with the acompaniment of a an ensemble. The vocal parts can be for soloists or for jiutai (chorus). The hayashi (instrumental ensemble) is comprised of one pitched instrument:  the nohkan (flute), and two unpitched percussion instruments:  the kotsuzumi  (shoulder drum) and ōtsuzumi (hip drum).  From the approximately 250 plays in the current repertoire, about half include a third drum, the taiko (stick drum). It is worth noting that even if in technical terms, the function of the hayashi is to create and maintain the proper mood and flow of a play, the musicians sit on stage facing the audience, and as such they are very much part of the visual aspect of a play.
</p>

  <p>  Unlike classical Western opera, which puts the composer's original creative act at its center, the music in Noh has no original music composed for individual plays. All plays draw from a common collection of rhythmic and melodic patterns that are adapted to outline and support specific dramatic needs. Many of the same patterns occur multiple times within a single play and in different sections of a play leading to a great unity and self-similarity. But this seeming constriction is more than balanced by enormous number of variants and flexibility with which the patterns are expressively inflected in specific plays and during particular performances.


  This chapter introduces some of these patterns and how they are used in the context.</p>

    <h3 id="Notation">Notation</h3>
    <p>A clarification must be made about the music notation used on this website. Conversely to Western tradition there are no complete study scores for any given play. Each of the twenty-four schools has their own individual scores and variants of notation (there are five shite, three waki, two ai-kyōgen, five ōtsuzumi, four kotsuzumi, two taiko, and three nohkan schools). In the performance of a Noh play, it is the school of the shite that becomes the reference and it is the responsibility of the waki and ai-kyōgen actors and musicians to adapt their parts to the shite’s. Scores for individual instruments are written on a grid of eight blocks and they are read from top to bottom and from right to left. </p>

    <p>On this website, all scores combining more than one instrument are our own transcriptions. We retained the characteristic note-heads of various percussion instruments’ strokes but set them on horizontal lines. Occasionally, due to limited space we have provided summarized scores, merging the ōtsuzumi’s and kotsuzumi’s patterns into a single line.</p>

    <p>For example, the following rhythmic patterns:</p>
    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-1-Complete.png" %}
    <p>have been notated as:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-1-Condensed.png" %}


     <p>And these patterns:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-2-Complete.png" %}
     <p>have been notated as:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-2-Condensed.png" %}

     <p>where the left strokes on the first, third and sixth beats corresponds to the ōtsuzumi’s stroke, the right ones to the kotsuzumi’s. We have followed the same sequencing when merging <em>kakegoe</em> and stroke, thus the <em>'yo''</em> on the second half of the fourth beat is called by the ōtsuzumi player at the same time as the kotsuzumi player performs a <em>pu</em> stroke.</p>

     <p>Finally, when the taiko is playing with the other two hand-drums, only its part has been notated.</p>
