    <h2>Elements of Music: an Introduction</h2>

    <p>Noh from a Western perspective can be considered a form of opera. It is a staged theatrical form in which actors sing their parts accompanied by an ensemble. The music plays a primary role in its expression. But unlike Western opera, which puts the composer's original creative act at its center, the music in Noh has no original music composed for individual plays. All plays share the same musical rhythmic and melodic patterns that are organized to outline and support specific dramatic needs. Many of the same patterns occur multiple times within a single play and in different sections leading to a great unity and self-similarity. But this seeming constriction is more than balanced by enormous number of variants and flexibility with which the patterns are utilized and expressively inflected in specific plays and during particular performances. This chapter introduces some of these patterns and how they are used in the context.</p>

    <p>The music of Noh consists of vocal and instrumental parts. The vocal music includes solo and jiutai (chorus) parts. The solo parts are peformed by actors playing different primary and secondary roles. The hayashi (instrumental ensemble)  in all Noh is comprised of one pitched instrument:  the nohkan (flute), and two unpitched percussion instruments:  the kotsuzumi  (shoulder drum) and ōtsuzumi (hip drum).  Although the number of plays in the current repertoire varies from school to school, it is approximately 250. Of that number, about half include a third drum, the taiko (stick drum). The hayashi is not merely accompanying the actors and chorus. They sit on stage, and as such they are very much part of the visual aspect of a play. In technical terms, the function of the hayashi is to create and maintain the proper mood and flow of a play.</p>

    <p>A clarification must be made about the music notation used on this website. Conversely to Western tradition there are no complete study scores for any given play. Each of the twenty-four schools has their own individual scores and variants of notation (there are five shite, three waki, two ai-kyōgen, five ōtsuzumi, four kotsuzumi, two taiko, and three nohkan schools). In the performance of a Noh play, it is the school of the shite that becomes the reference and it is the responsibility of the waki and ai-kyōgen actors and musicians to adapt their parts to the shite’s. Scores for individual instruments are written on a grid of eight blocks and they are read from top to bottom and from right to left. On this website, we retained the characteristic note-heads of various percussion instruments’ strokes but set them on a horizontal lines. All scores combining more than one instrument are our own transcriptions.</p>
