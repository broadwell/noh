<h2>Elements of Music: an Introduction</h2>

<p>Noh from a Western perspective can be considered a form of opera. It is a staged theatrical form in which actors sing their parts accompanied by an ensemble. The music plays a primary role in its expression. But unlike Western opera, which puts the composer's original creative act at its center, the music in Noh has no original music composed for individual plays. All plays share the same musical building blocks, rhythmic and melodic patterns that are organized to outline and support specific dramatic needs. Many of the same patterns occur multiple times within a single play and in different sections leading to a great unity and self-similarity. But this seeming constriction is more than balanced by enormous number of variants and flexibility with which the modules are utilized and expressively inflected in specific plays and during particular performances. This chapter is intended to introduce the reader to some of these building blocks and how they are put together.
