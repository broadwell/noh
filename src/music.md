    <h2>Elements of Music: an Introduction</h2>

    <p>Noh is a form of musical theater which features actors singing with the accompaniment of a an ensemble. Interestingly, the direct translation of the all-encompassing word ongaku (music) is not used by the Noh practitioners. The vocal parts are called utai, while the instrumental ensemble and its music is called hayashi. The vocal music is performed by soloists or jiutai (chorus). The actors sing alone or engage in exchanges with other actors or the juitai but never sing with them simultaneously. The hayashi is comprised of one pitched instrument: the nohkan (flute), and two unpitched percussion instruments: the kotsuzumi (shoulder drum) and ōtsuzumi (hip drum). From the approximately 250 plays in the current repertoire, about half include a third drum, the taiko (stick drum). </p><p>

Paragraph about the hierarchical structure of performers.</p><p>

The music in Noh draws on a common collection of rhythmic and melodic patterns that are adapted to outline and support specific dramatic needs. Many of the same patterns occur multiple times within a single play and in different sections of a play leading to a great unity and self-similarity. But this seeming constriction is well balanced by a richness of variants and tempi, a flexibility with which the patterns are sequenced, and by original expressive inflection of specific plays and particular performances. </p><p>

The melodic language of Noh is not dependent on absolute pitches or scales. With the nohkan being the only pitched instrument there is no possibility for the hayashi to tune to each other. There is no expected pitch coordination between nohkan and utai either although at times they share their general range to outline a common structure. The vocal pitch center is relative. The central note is instigated by the first person who starts the chant. The pitch range is informed by the category of the actor or the character whom they play. The secondary actors signal their lower position by providing lighter, faster and higher pitches (ex. Wakizure in Kokaji). Larger width of the range reflects that the protagonist is a man while narrower a woman. </p><p>

Discussion of rhythm and tempo (article of Takanori Fujita)</p><p>

The loudness of instruments is relatively consistent. The lower register of the flute is naturally softer and is used according to dramatic of formal function.  Similarly the kakegoe (vocal calls of the drummers) as well as chant can match the dramatic character of the scene or protagonist.  </p><p>

    <h3 id="Notation">Notation</h3>
    <p>A clarification must be made about the music notation used on this website. Conversely to Western tradition there are no complete study scores for any given play. Each of the twenty-four schools has their own individual scores and variants of notation (there are five shite, three waki, two ai-kyōgen, five ōtsuzumi, four kotsuzumi, two taiko, and three nohkan schools). In the performance of a Noh play, it is the school of the shite that becomes the reference and it is the responsibility of the waki and ai-kyōgen actors and musicians to adapt their parts to the shite’s. Scores for individual instruments are written on a grid of eight blocks and they are read from top to bottom and from right to left. </p>

    <p>On this website, all scores combining more than one instrument are our own transcriptions. We retained the characteristic note-heads of various percussion instruments’ strokes but set them on horizontal lines. Occasionally, due to limited space we have provided summarized scores, merging the ōtsuzumi’s and kotsuzumi’s patterns into a single line.</p>

    <p>For example, the following rhythmic patterns:</p>
    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-1-Complete.png" %}
    <p>have been notated as:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-1-Condensed.png" %}


     <p>And these patterns:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-2-Complete.png" %}
     <p>have been notated as:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Notation-2-Condensed.png" %}

     <p>where the left strokes on the first, third and sixth beats corresponds to the ōtsuzumi’s stroke, the right ones to the kotsuzumi’s. We have followed the same sequencing when merging <em>kakegoe</em> and stroke, thus the <em>'yo''</em> on the second half of the fourth beat is called by the ōtsuzumi player at the same time as the kotsuzumi player performs a <em>pu</em> stroke.</p>

     <p>Finally, when the taiko is playing with the other two hand-drums, only its part has been notated.</p>
