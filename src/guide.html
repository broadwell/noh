    <h4>Some pages use video examples that appear in pop-up windows. To be able to see them the readers are asked to enable browser pop-ups for this website.

    <h1> </h1>
    <p>
We hope that most of the navigation of this website is standard and self-explanatory but here are a few hints:</p>


<h4>Icons:</h4>

{% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/infoicon.png" %}
<p>
Clicking on links with this icon opens a new tab with the associated definition page. When the icon is found over a video just rolling over it shows additional information.</p>
{% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/fwdicon.png" %}

<p>Clicking on a term followed by this icon plays a video excerpt within the current page or in a temporary pop-up window.  </p>
    <h1> </h1>
<p>There are two primary levels of access to the featured plays:<br> Play Level and Shōdan Level
</p><p>

<h4>Play Level </h4>
<p>
The center of navigation is the Shōdan Map consisting of blocks representing modules of the play.Their width is proportional to their duration, and their height displays their Intermedia Texture Index as defined in the <a href="/about-intermedia#intermedia-tools" target="_blank">Introduction to the Intermedia Structure</a>.</p>

<p>Clicking on a block moves the video to the beginning of that <em>shōdan</em>. Scrubbing through the video timeline updates the time position within the map. Both interactions result in updating the corresponding summary info in the bottom right table.
</p>
{% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Level1.png" %}
<p>
Clicking on the red shōdan’s name at the top of the table, leads to its interemedia analysis on the <em>shōdan</em> Level.
</p>


<h4>Shōdan Level </h4>
<p>

The Text and Shōdan Map subwindows can be open or collaped by clicking on the title or the 'arrow' icon.
</p>
{% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Level2Text.png" %}

<p>
The lines of text are clickable and advance the video and score to their matching position within the shōdan.
</p><p>
Clicking on a block will update the video to the beginning of the Intermedia analysis of the corresponding shōdan.
</p>
{% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Level2ShodanMap.png" %}

<p>
The Filters offer readers a choice of elements that they wish to see updated during the playback of the score as well as previous and/or following sentence.
</p>
{% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Level2Filters.png" %}

<p>
The bottom horizontal bar allows for scrolling through the given shōdan.
</p>
{% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Level2bottomScrollBar.png" %}

<h3>General navigation</h3>
<p>
Many links open a new tab so that after learning additional information, the reader can close that tab and find themselves back on the original page in exactly the state that they left it.
<p>
The website allows for top to bottom and bottom up viewing of Noh.

Example of viewing trajectory:
After reading about the general <a href="/about-intermedia/" target="_blank">intermedia</a> characteristics of Noh plays, one can see one of them on the <a href="/hashitomi/" target="_blank">Play Level</a>. To learn more about their intricate workings one can move to the <a href="/hashitomi/nanori/" target="_blank">Shōdan Level</a> where various terms lead to their <a href="/music/voices/#Chanted">theoretical definitions</a> all the way to <a href="/music/taiko/#Strokes" target="_blank">a single stroke on a drum</a>.
