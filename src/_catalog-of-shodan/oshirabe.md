  <p><em>Oshirabe</em> means ‘to tune’ and it refers to the musicians adjusting their instruments before the performance of a play, therefore, it is not an actual <em>shōdan</em>. It is said to signal to the audience that the performance of the play is about to begin, but for others it serves as a transition from living reality to theater's. </p>

  <p>The performers sit in a prescribed order (facing the curtain, from left to right): Nohkan, kotsuzumi, ōtsuzumi, and taiko if one is used in the play. The sound of the instruments is introduced one at a time. The nohkan player opens and closes the <em>oshirabe</em> with the pattern: <em>ho ho ho fu fu</em>, interposed by the three patterns: <em>ho hya riu</em>, <em>ho hiu hiu</em>, and <em>ro ra riu</em>. The staggered entrance of the percussion instruments follows the sitting order, hence the kotsuzumi enters shortly after the nohkan, followed by the others. Musicians do not attempt to tune to one another, rather they are tuning their instruments to the play’s <em>kurai</em>, that is its overall atmosphere. </p>

  <p>The nohkan’s five-pattern melody and the prescribed sequenced entrance of the percussion instruments is common to all <em>oshirabe</em>.
  Yet differences in its performance help set different moods.
  An obvious difference between Kokaji’s <em>oshirabe</em> with Hashitomi’s relates to timbre since the instrumentation of the former includes a taiko, whereas the latter does not. Subtle differences can also make a difference. For instance, the performance of Hashitomi’s <em>oshirabe</em> on this website is longer than Kokaji’s by more than twenty seconds, suggesting that the musicians felt that longer durations were appropriate to set the mood for a play about a young lady, compared with shorter durations for a play featuring a dynamic deity. </p>
