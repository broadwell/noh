  <p>It is one of the most important <em>shōdan</em> of a play, and context help appreciate that fact. The standard development of play starts with the waki, who delivers a speech with factual information about who he is, where he is coming from, where he is going and why. Then, the shite enters and sings a song that reveals nothing about his/her identity but sparks the waki's curiosity. Hence, follows a spoken dialogue between the two actors during which the waki questions the shite trying to better understand who he is talking to.</p>

  <p>The <em>kuse</em> which is often the first dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em> of a play, tells the shite's story, and as such it is a poetical answer to the waki's questions, but the lifting of the mystery around the shite's identity depends on the positioning of the kuse within the play's structure.
  When presented in the first act, the <em>kuse</em> does not reveal the shite's identity, rather the story refers to a generic character, as it the case with Kokaji’s <em>kuse</em>. Usually, first act's <em>kuse</em> do not include a dance, since the shite usually only dances once his/her identity has been revealed.
  But there are exceptions to this pattern such as Nonomiya and Kokaji, among others. But in both cases, the shite only starts dancing after his last solo. On the other hand, when presented in the second act, the <em>kuse</em> does reveal the shite's identity, therefore second act's kuse usually includes a dance, as it is the case with Hashitomi’s.</p>

  <p>A long thematic chant set in <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori"><em>hiranori</em></a>, it begins slowly in the lower range and finishes in the higher range, while its overall rhythmic structure moves from unstable to steady. This motion is controlled by the patterns of the  two hand-drums whose ratio <em>mitsuji</em> to <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns, initially favoring the sporadic <a href="/music/OtsuzumiKotsuzumi/Mitsuji"><em>mitsuji</em></a> gradually giving way to the regular <a href="/music/OtsuzumiKotsuzumi/Tsuzuke"><em>tsuzuke</em></a> pattern.  At the same time, the declamatory voice setting <a href="/music/voices#Mitsujiutai"><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a> is gradually replaced with the rhythmic <a href="/music/voices#Tsuzukeutai"><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a> setting. The metric structure (7+5) of the text synchronized with the percussion contributes to the change in overall expression from descriptive to poetic, shifting the emphasis from verbal to non-verbal.
  </p>

  <p>It is sung by the chorus with the exception of a one or two solos called <em>ageha</em>, that are sung by the shite. There is only one <em>ageha</em> in Hashitomi that is immediately followed by the nohkan’s <a href="/music/nohkan/Takanemikusari"><em>takane mi kusari</em></a> pattern, its single entrance in the <em>shōdan</em>. On the other hand, the shite sings three verses in Kokaji. Having performed its <a href="/music/nohkan/Nakanotakane"><em>naka no takane</em></a> pattern early at the beginning of the <em>shōdan</em>, the nohkan follows the shite’s first <em>ageha</em> with the <em>takane mi kusari</em> pattern and  marks the end of the second one with the  <em>hishigi takane mi kusari</em> pattern. The shite’s third verse is not followed by a nohkan’s pattern, rather it anticipates the beginning of the dance.</p>

  <p>The <em>kuse</em> 'segment' is composed of a sequence of <em>shōdan</em>, the last of which is the <em>kuse</em> proper. The number of <em>shōdan</em> comprising it can vary but a full <em>kuse</em> consists of six: <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/Shidaimusic"><em>shidai</em></a>,
  <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/Isseimusic"><em>issei</em></a>, short dance such as an <em>Iroe mai</em>, <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/Kuri"><em>kuri</em></a>,
  <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/Sashi"><em>sashi</em></a> and <em>kuse</em>. Kakitsubata is a good example of a play with a full kuse. For an instances of a variations of this model, the sequence of <em>shōdan</em> in the play Yamamba leaves out the short dance, Kokaji's <em>kuse's</em> sequence is limited to  <em>kuri</em>, <em>sashi</em> and <em>kuse</em>, while in Hashitomi <em>kuse</em> stands alone.</p>
