    <p>Popular term among <strong>the performers</strong> for the <em>final shōdan</em> of a play. It is the second dance-to-text shōdan of a play, the kuse being potentially the first one. In scholarly circles this module is usually differentiated on the basis of its rhythmic organization: it is called noriji when set in ōnori, chūnoriji when set in chūnori, but there is no specific name when set in hiranori.</p>
    <p>We have used the generic term kiri for the last module of both plays.</p>

      <td class="content-table__column">The primary actor and vocal soloist is usually masked. In some plays the shite has a companion actor called the shite tsure who can also be masked. Although the tsure can also dance, if only one is to dance it will always be the shite. The story evolves around him. At first, we usually know nothing if not very little about his true identity. Often he is a character from another world, embodying for example a divine being or deceased person. In the latter case, (and considering that most plays are composed of two acts) the first act shite is often a spirit who has taken the form of a person, and the ghost or apparition of the same spirit in the second act.  KONGÔ Tatsunori and UDAKA Tatsushige, the shite featured in the examples are from the Kongô school.</td>

      <td class="content-table__column">Waki</td>
      <td class="content-table__column">The secondary actor is always a male character living in the narrative present hence he is never masked. We usually know much about him since he often introduces himself at the very beginning of a play. He engages the shite and as such provides him with a reason to appear and perform. Plays without a waki are exceptionally few. The waki is always a realistic character. There are three majors types of waki character: a shrine official or retainer; a warrior; or most commonly a traveling priest. In some plays the waki has one or few unmasked companion actors called waki tsure. Featured ARIMATSU Ryôichi is from the Takayasu school.</td>
