  <p>Usually a dialogue between the shite and the waki, the function of the <em>kakeai</em> is to move the plot forward. Not to interfere with this goal, if the musical accompaniment is present it consists of solely the percussion instruments set in flexible mode. The accompaniment is there only in plays like Kokaji, if <em>kakeai</em> is positioned between other accompanied modules in a larger segment that has high energy and the plot is already well understood. <em>Kakeai</em>  starts in kotoba and concludes with unmetered sung verse in <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori" target="_blank"><em>sashinori</em></a>. The text corresponding to the switch of the mode of delivery is as a consequence subtly emphasized. When unaccompanied by musicians, the singing mode in <em>kakeai</em> gives more emphasis to words than the speech mode can.   </p>

  <p>In Noh, the spoken mode tends to be used for true conversations between characters in their real-time present. This changes once a character starts singing (usually in <em>sashinori</em>). The switch may suggest that he may now be in a world of his own such as a dream, in a solitary space or just sharing a monologue. </p>

  <p>Between the two plays there are three <em>kakeai</em>, one in Hashitomi and two in Kokaji. Hashitomi’s <em>kakeai</em> is a typical example. It  opens the First act’s ‘Dialogue’ section, and is performed by two actors without accompaniment. At this point in the play, the shite who is standing at the second pine on the bridge, has just completed his entrance chant. The waki who is kneeling at <a href=“/staging/stage/#Squares” target="_blank">Square 5</a>, is performing a flower service for Buddha. It is in <em>kotoba</em> that he expresses his surprise when noticing among his lot a white flower that he cannot name.
  When the shite identifies the flower as <em>iugao</em>, his reply is in singing mode rather than in <em>kotoba</em>. Doing so brings emphasis to the words and more specifically to the flower’s name <em>iugao</em>, an important clue to help reveal that the identity of the character played by the shite is possibly Lady Yūgao. The waki, staying in singing mode, insists on asking the woman to identify herself. At this point, she switches mode back to <em>kotoba</em> to reaffirm a refusal to divulge her name but hints that she has come "from the flower’s shadow”.</p>


    <p>Delivery in <a href="/music/voices#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a> is recognizable by the declamation's rising tone, identified in the video with bold syllables. The switching point between the two modes can be identified by the introduction of the vibrato associated with the singing mode.</p>

    <p>Both Kokaji's <em>kakeai</em> are short, standing between two congruent <em>shōdan</em>, and as such they essentially function as bridges. In both cases, the two percussionists who perform in the adjacent <em>shōdan</em>, continue to play in the <em>kakeai</em>, but switch from a strict rhythmic setting for the adjacent <em>shōdan</em> to flexible for the performance of the <em>kakeai</em>.</p>

    <p>Kokaji’s first <em>kakeai</em> is performed by two protagonists accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments. It opens the First act’s ‘Shite exits’ part and is positioned between two congruent <em>shōdan</em> set in <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori" target="_blank"><em>hiranori</em></a>: the <em>kuse</em> and the third <em>ageuta</em>.</p>

    <p>Kokaji’s second <em>kakeai</em> is also performed by two protagonists accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments. It opens the Second act’s ‘Shite exits’ part and is positioned between two congruent <em>shōdan</em>: the third <em>noriji</em> set in <a href="/music/voices#Onori" target="_blank"><em>ōnori</em></a> and the <em>kiri</em> set mainly in <a href="/music/voices#Chunori" target="_blank"><em>chūnori</em></a>.</p>
