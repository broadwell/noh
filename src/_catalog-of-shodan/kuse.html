<p> The name <em>kuse</em> comes from a larger formal notion of <em>kuse-mai</em>, or ‘kuse-dance’. The <em>kuse-mai</em> refers to a sequence of shōdan, the last of which is the kuse proper. It is assumed that the <em>kuse-mai</em> existed before Noh and was abbridged to become its part. A typical <em>kuse-mai</em> consists of six shōdan: <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/shidai-chant" target="_blank"><em> shidai</em></a>,
<a href="/catalog-of-shodan/issei-chant" target="_blank"><em> issei</em></a>, short dance such as an <em>iroe mai</em>, <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/kuri" target="_blank"><em> kuri</em></a>,
<a href="/catalog-of-shodan/sashi" target="_blank"><em> sashi</em></a> and <em>kuse</em> with 2 solos lines sung by the shite. Kakitsubata is an example of a play with a typical full <em>kuse-mai</em> but majority of plays present variations of this model featuring just subsets of the shōdan. The most common sequence, when in the first act, consists of kuri, sashi, and kuse with single solo line of the shite. This is the case of Kokaji except for having three shite solo lines. Hashitomi’s <em>kuse</em> is the most abridged as it is a stand-alone kuse with one solo line by the shite.

</p>
  <p><em>Kuse</em> can be part of either act, which then may change some of its characteristicsis but it is always one of the most important <em>shōdan</em> of a play. There are several reasons for this status. It is among the most extended of the <em>shōdan</em>, it focuses on the main actor and most importantly, it plays a key role in giving depth to the story or the main character and as such, to the play's formal development.</p>

  <p>The standard play starts with the waki arriving on stage and introducing himself. Then, the shite enters and sings a song that reveals nothing about his/her true identity but sparks enough of waki's curiosity for a dialogue between them to follow. The waki questions the shite trying to better understand who he is talking to. The <em>kuse</em> typically describes events related to the shite's story or the context for it. As such it is an indirect but rich poetical answer to the waki's questions. </p>

  <p> In the <em>kuse</em> the shite may remain seated (<em>iguse</em>) or may dance. Since the energy and emotional engagement are higher in the second act the danced <em>kuse</em> are more prevalent there. In both cases, the shite only starts dancing after having delivered his last solo line called <em>ageha</em>. <em>Kuse</em> is often the first <a href="/about-movement/#dance-to-text">dance-to-text</a> <em>shōdan</em> of a play,

  <p>The <em>kuse</em> is a long thematic chant. Its poetic text potentially in <a href="/text/#Rhythmic-R/" target="_blank">regular</a> rhythm, but most often <a href="/text/#Rhythmic-I/" target="_blank">irregular</a> is set in <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori" target="_blank"><em>hiranori</em></a>. The <em>kuse</em> begins slowly in the lower range and finishes in the higher range, while its overall rhythmic structure moves from unstable to steady. This motion is controlled by the patterns of the  two hand-drums whose ratio of <em>mitsuji</em> to <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns, initially favoring the sporadic <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> gradually gives way to the regular <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke</em></a> pattern.
  At the same time, the declamatory voice setting <a href="/music/voices/#Mitsuji-utai" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a> is gradually replaced with the steady <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-utai" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a>. The metric structure (7+5) of the text synchronized with the percussion contributes to the change in overall expression from prosaic to poetic, shifting the emphasis from verbal to non-verbal.
  </p>

  <p><em>Kuse</em> is sung by the jiutai with the exception of a one or two solos (<em>ageha</em>), that are sung by the shite. The only <em>ageha</em> in Hashitomi is immediately followed by the nohkan’s <a href="/music/nohkan/takanemikusari"target="_blank"><em>takane mi kusari</em></a> pattern, its single entrance in the <em>shōdan</em>. As for the three verses in Kokaji, having performed its <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane"target="_blank"><em>naka no takane</em></a> pattern early at the beginning of the <em>shōdan</em>, the nohkan follows the shite’s first <em>ageha</em> with the <em>takane mi kusari</em> pattern and marks the end of the second one with <a href="/music/nohkan/hishigi-takane"target="_blank"><em>hishigi takane mi kusari</em></a>. The shite’s third verse is not followed by a nohkan’s pattern, rather it pauses to begin afresh at the beginning of the dance.</p>
