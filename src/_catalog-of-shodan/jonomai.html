  <p>
  This refined and calm dance is usually presented by a shite impersonating a woman, as is the case with Hashitomi, or rarely an old man. It has a three-layered texture: the choreography of the dance, the nohkan and the percussion instruments. The nohkan provides a cyclical melodic background, and through its recurring patterns articulates the dance’s five sections: <em>jo</em>, <em>kakari</em> and three <em>dan</em> sections named after their starting segment called <em>dan</em>. The complete dance, as shown in the <a href="/hashitomi/jonomai/" target="_blank">full play recording</a> on this website, includes all of the above five sections. Some plays following the <em>jo</em> and <em>kakari</em>, include only one dan. </p>
  <p>
  The beginning of Hashitomi's <em>jonomai</em> is preceded by a one-<em>honji</em> bridge from the preceding <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>kuse</em>. The non-congruent jiutai, accompanied by the two percussion instruments in flexible setting, introduces the first line of the poem Genji wrote in response to Lady Yūgao’s. The jiutai extends the poem’s last vowel over the next <em>honji</em> overlapping with the beginning of the <em>jonomai</em>.</p>
  <p>

  The name <em>jonomai</em> stems from its introductory section called <em>jo</em>, which can be translated as an introduction. The three <em>honji</em>-long section stands apart from the rest of the dance as well as from other instrumental dances as the only section that includes a non-congruent nohkan and percussion in flexible rhythm.</p>
  <p>
  <em>Kakari</em> is the noun derived from the verb <em>kakaru</em>, which means to initiate or to get into something. In the context of the <em>jonomai</em> it could be understood as getting into the congruent-mode phase of the dance, thus being its second introduction after <em>jo</em>.</p>
  <p>
  It is in the <em>kakari</em> that the nohkan introduces the dance’s core sequence of patterns called <em>Ji</em> or 'ground'. It is composed of four eight-beat segments, each one beginning on a second-and-a-half beat of its corresponding honji. They are respectively labelled: <em>Chū, Kan, Kannochū,</em> and <em>Ryo,</em> where <em>Kannochū</em> is either a variation or repetition of <em>Chū</em>. The outline melodic shape produced by their sequencing is a four-<em>honji</em>  long wave with the <em>Chū</em> pattern in medium range, <em>Kan</em> in medium but reaching into higher range, then back to the medium range with the <em>Kannochū</em> or <em>Chū</em>, before  descending into the lower range in the middle of <em>Ryo</em>. The <em>Ji</em> pattern is played four times in this <em>kakari</em>.</p>
  <p>
  Each of the three <em>dan</em> that follows includes two parts. Part-I can be recognized by an extended 'iya' kakegoe call of the ōtsuzumi preceding every <em>dan</em>. It introduces a short sequence of new and recurring nohkan segments. For instance, Part-I of the First section introduces a sequence of five segments: <em>Dan</em>, <em>Kannochū</em>, <em>Oroshi</em>, <em>Kannochū</em>, and <em>Ryo</em>. Part-I of the Second section is almost identical except that the <em>Oroshi</em> is preceded by a <em>Ryo</em>. This results in the sequence: <em>Dan</em>, <em>Kannochū</em>, <em>Ryo</em>, <em>Oroshi</em>, <em>Kannochū</em>, and <em>Ryo</em>. They are all eight-beat long except for the <em>Oroshi</em> which lasts sixteen beats. <em>Oroshi</em> is also a unique moment of significant slow down. The Third section’s Part-I is slightly different, its sequence of segments being: <em>Dan</em>, <em>Chū</em>, <em>Ryo</em>, where all segments are eight-beat long except for the <em>Dan</em>, which lasts sixteen.</p>

  <p>
  All Part-II sections are comprised of two <em>Ji</em> as heard in <em>kakari</em>, plus unique combinations of one or two additional segments. </p>

  <p id="Oroshi">A special note should be taken of the <em>oroshi</em> pattern. It is not only the longest but it is also the slowest since <em>oroshi</em> means to slow down. The <em>jonomai’s</em> five sections are spread over 64 <em>honji</em>, as shown in this figure, where the Y axis gives duration in seconds (the higher the peak the slower the tempo): </p>

  {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/jonomai-tempo.png" %}

  <p>The figure shows that the five sections are merged into an overall accelerando that is relaxed in the first and second <em>dan</em>, where the highest peaks correspond to the two-<em>honji</em> long <em>Oroshi</em>.</p>

  <p>The instrumental version of the <em>jonomai</em> included in this Catalog of <em>shōdan</em> is abridged. It starts with the bridge from the <em>kuse</em>, followed by the <em>Jo's</em> three <em>honji</em>, labelled Intro: 1, 2, 3, respectively, which leads to <em>Kakari</em> with four presentations of the <em>Ji</em> pattern.</p>
