  <p>This is a virile and animated dance that accompanies the dance of a God-dragon, demon, or a deity as it is the case in Kokaji. It is always accompanied by the three percussion instruments and the nohkan.</p>

  <p>The <em>maibataraki</em> has a three-layered structure articulated by the nohkan, percussion instruments and the choreography of the dance.
  The nohkan provides a cyclical melodic background, and through its recurring patterns it articulates the dance’s three parts: <em>kakari</em>, <em>ji</em>, and <em>dan</em>. The leading percussion instrument, the taiko uses its distinguishable <a href="/music/taiko/#Kashira" target="_blank"><em>kashira</em></a> pattern to articulate the beginning and closing of its rhythmic cycles, which are well synchronized with the nohkan's patterns, thereby helping articulate the dance’s three sections.</p>

  <h3>Kakari</h3>
  <p>The <em>kakari</em> is spread over two eight-beat measures (<em>honji</em>). It can be translated as ‘taking the time to perform something’, and in the case of the <em>maibataraki</em>, it is used to set the dance’s dynamic and upbeat mood.
  Moreover, the taiko who is leading the percussion section opens and closes the <em>kakari</em> with <em>kashira</em> patterns that clearly delineate the section’s boundaries.</p>

  <h3>Ji</h3>
  <p>It is in this section that the nohkan player introduces a core sequence of three patterns that we labelled: a, b, and c, each one lasting one <em>honji</em>. The sequenced three patterns, which constitute the <em>Ji</em>, have a clear melodic quality that contrasts with the opening rhythmic patterns. The sequence can be interrupted after any of the three patterns to move on to the closing <em>dan</em> section. In this recording, the <em>Ji</em> is played twice, but the second time, pattern 'c' is dropped as the ensemble starts the closing section afer the pattern 'b'. The duration of the <em>Ji</em>  coincides with the taiko’s first cycle of patterns clearly perceptible with its opening and closing <em>kashira</em> patterns.</p>

  <h3>Dan</h3>
  <p>The beginning and end of the last section of the dance are once again clearly marked by the hayashi. The nohkan starts the four-<em>honji</em> <em>dan</em>, with two new one-<em>honji</em> patterns followed by a return of its pattern ‘a’, which leads to the cadential pattern <em>tome</em>. Its sequence of patterns can be summarized as: d, e, a, <em>tome</em>. The two new patterns: ‘d’ and ‘e’, help mark the start of the section.
  The <em>dan's</em> four <em>honji</em> also coincide with the taiko’s second cycle patterns. In fact, the taiko’s dropping-out in the <em>dan's</em> first <em>honji</em> creates a sudden change of density that helps mark the beginning of the <em>dan</em>.</p>

  <p>To help appreciate the complexity between the <em>hayashi's</em> four parts, the <em>maibataraki</em> is presented at three different speeds: The original, and at 75% and at 50% of the original speed.
