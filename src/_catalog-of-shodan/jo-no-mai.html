  <p>
  This refined and calm dance is usually presented by a shite impersonating an old man or a lady, as it is the case with Hashitomi. The complete dance includes five sections, while the abbreviated version has three. The version performed in the play Hashitomi, as it appears on this website, includes all five. </p>
  <p>
  The <em>jo no mai</em>  has a three-layered structure articulated by the nohkan, percussion instruments and the choreography of the dance.
  The nohkan provides a cyclical melodic background, and through its recurring patterns it articulates the dance’s five parts: <em>jo, kakari</em>, and three sections.</p>
  <p>
  The beginning of Hashitomi's <em>jo no mai</em> is preceded by a one-<em>honji</em> bridge from the preceding <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>kuse</em>. The non-congruent jiutai, accompanied by the two percussion instruments in flexible setting, introduces the first line of the poem Genji wrote in response to Lady Yūgao’s poem. The jiutai extends the poem’s last vowel over the next <em>honji</em> overlapping with the beginning of the <em>jo no mai</em>.</p>
  <p>
  The <em>jo</em> is spread over three <em>honji</em>. It is the only section of the dance that is non-congruent. </p>
  <p>
  <em>Kakari</em> can be translated as ‘introduction’, in the case of the <em>jo no mai</em> it refers to the nohkan introducing the dance’s core sequence of patterns called <em>Ji</em>. It is composed of four eight-beat patterns, each one beginning on a second beat and a half of its corresponding <em>honji</em>. They are respectively labelled: <em>Chū</em>, <em>Kan</em>, <em>Kan no Chū</em>, and <em>Ryo</em>, where <em>Kan no Chū</em> is either a variation or repetition of <em>Chū</em>. The melodic shape produced by their sequencing is a four-<em>honji</em> long sinus wave with the <em>Chū</em> pattern in medium range, <em>Kan</em> in the higher range, then back to the medium range with the <em>Kan no Chū</em>, before reaching the lower range with the <em>Ryo</em> pattern. The <em>Ji</em> pattern is played four times in this <em>kakari</em>.</p>
  <p>
  Each of the three sections that follows is composed of two parts. Part-I introduces a phrase composed of a short sequence of a mixture of new and recurring nohkan patterns. For instance, Part-I of the First section introduces a sequence of five patterns: <em>Dan</em>, <em>Kan no Chū</em>, <em>Oroshi</em>, <em>Chū</em>, and <em>Ryo</em>. The structure of Part-I of the Second section is almost identical except that the <em>Oroshi</em> is preceded by a <em>Ryo</em>: <em>Dan</em>, <em>Kan no Chū</em>, <em>Ryo</em>, <em>Oroshi</em>, <em>Kan no Chū</em>, and <em>Ryo</em>. They are all eight-beat long except for the <em>Oroshi</em> which lasts sixteen beats. The structure of the Third section’s Part-I is slightly different, its sequence of patterns being: <em>Dan</em>, <em>Kan no Chū</em>, <em>Ryo</em>, where all patterns are eight-beat long except for the <em>Dan</em> which lasts sixteen beats.</p>
  <p>
  All three sections are followed with two <em>Ji</em> plus one or two additional patterns. The structure of the <em>jo no mai</em> as performed by the Kongō school can be summarized as:</p>

  <p>The instrumental version of the <em>jo no mai</em> included in this Catalog of <em>shōdan</em> starts with the Bridge from the <em>kuse</em>, followed by the <em>jo's</em> three <em>honji</em>, labelled Intro: 1, 2, 3, respectively, which leads to four presentations of the <em>Ji</em> pattern.</p>
