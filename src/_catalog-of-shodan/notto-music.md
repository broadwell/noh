  <p>The <em>notto</em> is divided up into two parts: music and chant. The <em>notto</em>-music is an unsettling introduction that has an evocative character. It is characterized by a percussion accompaniment in strict setting played by the kotsuzumi and the ōtsuzumi, and a non-congruent nohkan part. It always leads to the <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/notto-chant"><em>notto</em>-chant</a>.</p>

  <p>The kosuzumi’s steady eight-beat <em>notto uchi tsume</em> pattern is a signature feature of this <em>shōdan</em>.This steady pattern serves as a foundation superposed with various ōtsuzumi’s patterns and the non-congruent nohkan part composed of five segments:</p>
  <p>1-	Hi-hya u-ta  u-ta  u-ta  u-ta  u-ta  u-ta  u</p>
  <p>2-	Hyū i-ya</p>
  <p>3-	Hiu ri-u</p>
  <p>4-	Hi-hya uru ro-i ya</p>
  <p>5-	O-hya  i-cho uho-u</p>

  <p>The notto-music is spread over seven honji, the beginning of the <em>notto</em>-chant overlapping with the end of the nohkan solo.</p>

  %}

  <p>The performance of an entrance music varies according to the action on the stage. In the play version, the nohkan player anticipated that he needed to extend duration of the <em>notto</em>-music, hence he interjected a new pattern between the second and third one:</p>
  <p>O-hya ro-ru-ra</p>
