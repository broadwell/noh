  <p>Set in <a href="/music/voices#onori"><em>ōnori</em></a>, it typically appears in a concluding part of a play. It normally follows but can also lead to the main dance. There are three <em>noriji</em> in Kokaji and they are all related to the main dance: <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/Maibataraki"><em>maibataraki</em></a>. The first one leads to the entrance music <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/Hayafue"><em>hayafue</em></a> which is followed by the second <em>noriji</em> leading into the <em>maibataraki</em> followed by the third <em>noriji</em>.
  As it is often the case with the <em>noriji</em>, all three include a taiko part whose cycles of rhythmic patterns help articulate the <em>shōdan's</em> structure.</p>

  <p>Kokaji's first <em>noriji</em> starts with a transition phrase delivered by the waki bridging it with the preceding <em>notto</em>. It is sung by the jiutai accompanied by the three percussion instruments.</p>

  <p>Kokaji's second <em>noriji</em> is sung by the jiutai accompanied by the three percussion instruments.  It is the only one that includes a nohkan’s part, as if the <a href="/music/nohkan/TAkanehane"><em>takane hane</em></a> patterns was anticipating the dance to come.</p>
