  <p>Lively music for the entrance of a dragon, spirit, or deity, as it is the case in Kokaji. It is a nohkan congruent solo accompanied by the three percussion instruments. The  eight-beat introduction melody called <em>kakari</em>, opens with the strident <em>hishigi</em> tone and leads to a seven-<em>honji</em> melody with one motive per <em>honji</em>. It is repeated twice, then the first four <em>honji</em> are introduced a third time leading into the two-<em>honji</em> cadence called <em>tome</em>.
</p>
<p>The taiko performs a complete cycle of patterns over the melody’s first iteration, and a second one over the rest of the <em>hayafue</em>. The two-hand percussion instruments contribute to the complex rhythmic texture by performing rhythmic ostinati of different durations.
