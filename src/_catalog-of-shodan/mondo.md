  <p>Dialogue in prose between the shite and waki, usually used to reveal some information about the shite’s past and/or identity.</p>

  <p>Between the two plays there are two <em>mondō</em>, both are in Kokaji. They provide examples of the declamation style favored by some waki schools, where words are first delivered on a single repeated tone whose pulse accelerates as it decidedly raises in pitch and gradually descends towards the end of sentence, creating a melodic contour that embodies the <em>jo-ha-kyū</em> principle. These 'melodic curves' follow the grammatical structure of the text, the peak being reached just before the end of the sentence.
  Bold syllables are used in the excerpt to identify the higher pitch that triggers the following descent.</p>

  <p>Kokaji’s first <em>mondō</em> is the second <em>shōdan</em> of the First act’s ‘Waki enters’ part. Preceded by a <em>nanori</em>, it maintains the <a href="/music/voices#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a> style of delivery but the texture moves from one to two speaking voices.
  The dialogue is between a waki-tsure impersonating an authoritative Emperor’s envoy, and a waki, the humble swordsmith Munechika Kokaji.</p>

  <p>Kokaji’s second <em>mondō</em> is the third out of four <em>shōdan</em> in the First act’s ‘Dialogue’.  It starts with a <em>yobikake</em>, that is a call from the distance. As such, the entrance of the shite in Kokaji's first act is uncommon as it is not preceded by any music. He enters with a <em>yobikake</em>, an unexpected call from the distance, hence the curtain is lifted, yet he is still out of sight in the mirror room, as he delivers this statement intended to the waki who is on stage. The addition of any entrance music would have spoiled the surprise effect.</p>
  <p>This <em>mondō</em> offers two points of comparison between a shite and waki’s <em>kotoba</em> styles.
  The first point relates to the gradual rising tone. While they both use a rising line to get to a peak-tone, the overall ascent of the shite’s line is more subdued compared with the waki’s. The second point relates to the rhythm of delivery, the shite’s being much slower than the waki. These two points are not to be understood as universal stylistic characteristics, but rather as performance differences, the shite’s less flamboyant style being well suited to a deity. Moreover, the difference between the two styles helps setting apart the divine being (shite ) from the mere human (waki).</p>
