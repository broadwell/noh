  <p><em>Raijo</em> is an instrumental piece. It is composed of two sections: The first one called <em>nakairi-raijo</em>, is slow and non-congruent, creating a stately mood for the exit of one or two characters. The tempo picks up at the end in preparation for the second section which is congruent. This one is called <em>kyōgen-raijo</em>, since it accompanies the entrance of the ai-kyōgen actor.</p>

  <p>The featured instrument is the nohkan, accompanied by the three percussion instruments whose respective rhythmic patterns merge into a single macro-pattern.
  In this performance, it is after a measure of easing-in that the percussion patterns get settled. The three rhythm layers of the <em>nakairi-raijo's</em> macro-rhythm shows that its beginning is clearly marked by an upbeat stroke on the kotsuzumi’s first beat.</p>

<p>The <em>kyōgen-raijo</em> tempo is faster and being congruent, the <em>kakegoe</em> are shorter. Moreover, its macro-rhythm differs from the <em>nakairi-raijo's</em>, more specifically the kotsuzumi upbeat <em>chi</em> stroke around the first beat has been removed, replaced with one on the <em>honji's</em> sixth beat.</p>

  <p>It is against the percussion’s static macro-rhythm that the nohkan performs its melody. It is composed of two segments that are successively repeated until the exit and entrance of the protagonists have been completed. The provided <em>shoga</em> shows that the segments can be varied with each iteration. As it is often the case the <em>shoga</em> provide the experienced performer with a reference that can be modified, thus the <em>shoga</em> shown in the video's score corresponds to Morita sensei's interpretation.</p>

  <p> The non-congruent first part, which accompanies the exiting shite and waki, covers five <em>honji</em>, with each segment spread over one <em>honji</em>. Starting around the second beat, the nohkan's music focuses on even beats against the percussion strokes on odd beats.</p>

  <p>1a- O-hya hyu i-ya ro ro-u ro-u ro-u ro-i-shi</p>
  <p>2a- Hi hyo i-ya-u ra-ro ra-fu o-hya ro-ru ra-ra</p>
  <p>1b- O-hya rya fu hya ro-ru-ri ro-u ro-u ro-u ro-i-shi</p>
  <p>2b- Hi hyo i-ya-u ra-ro ra-fu o-hya ro-ru ra-ra</p>
  <p>1c- O-hya rya fu hya ro-ru-ri hi hyo</p>

  <p>The congruent second part, that support the kyōgen’s entrance, covers five <em>honji</em>. In this case, the first segment is spread over three <em>honji</em>, the second one over two.</p>

  <p>2c- Hi hyo i-ya-u ra-ro ra-fu o-hya ro-ru ra-ra</p>
  <p>1d- O-hya rya fu hya ro-ru-ri hi hyo</p>
