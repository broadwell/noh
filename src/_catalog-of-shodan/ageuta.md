<p>The ageuta chant set in <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori"><em>hiranori</em></a>, starts in the higher range and finishes in either the medium or low range. It is sung by an actor, jiutai, or alternatively, by an actor and jiutai.</p>
  <p>

It is often composed of two parts clearly discernable by the nohkan’s material. In the first part, the nohkan player performs the <a href="/music/nohkan/Takane"><em>takane</em></a> pattern, while in the second one he performs two patterns: <a href="/music/nohkan/Nakanotakane"><em>naka no takane</em></a> or a variation of it, and <a href="/music/nohkan/Mirokunoge"><em>mi roku no ge</em></a>. The first pattern is in the high register of the instrument whereas the second one starts in the medium range and finishes in the low range, mirroring the overall descent of register of the vocal line.</p>
  <p>

The ageuta is often used to close the ‘Waki and Shite enter’ parts, as well as the first act.</p>
  <p>

Between the two plays there are five <em>ageuta</em> sections.
</p>
  <p>The <em>ageuta</em> chant starts in the higher range and finishes in either the medium or low range. It is set in <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori"><em>hiranori.</em></a></p>

<h3>Hashitomi’s second <em>ageuta</em></h3><p>is written for jiutai and hayashi. It closes the ‘Shite re-enters’ part. Because it is a short <em>ageuta</em>, the nohkan’s part  includes only the <em>takane</em> pattern. But it is not performed in this production since it coincides more or less with the removal of the drape around the <em>tsukurimono</em> that hides the shite. The nohkan’s part has been left out so that the focus is on the apperance of the shite.</p>

<h3>Kokaji’s first <em>ageuta</em></h3><p>is written for an actor (waki), jiutai, and hayashi. It closes the first act’s ‘Waki enters’ part.</p>


<h3>Kokaji’s second <em>ageuta</em></h3> <p>is written for jiutai and hayashi. It closes the first act’s ‘Dialogue’ part. Being the second <em>ageuta</em> in the play, the nohkan’s pattern <em>takane</em> is replaced with <em>hishigi takane</em>.</p>

<h3>Kokaji’s third <em>ageuta</em></h3> <p>is written for jiutai and hayashi. It closes the first act’s ‘Shite exits’ part. There is no <a href="/music/Otsuzumi&Kotsuzumi/Uchikiri"><em>uchikiri</em></a> separating the first line from its repetition, thus the nohkan player does not play the <em>takane</em> pattern. Although the <em>shōdan's</em> second part usually includes nohkan music, it is not played when the production includes the exit music <em>raijo</em> as it is the case with this production.</p>
