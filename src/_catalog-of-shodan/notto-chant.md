  <p>Sung in <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori"><em>sashinori</em></a> style, it usually depicts scenes of prayer. It is preceded by an entrance music also called <em>notto</em>, thus we refer to it as <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/notto-music"><em>notto</em>-music</a> to avoid confusion. The <em>notto</em>-chant is sung in <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin"><em>tsuyogin</em></a> style, over a steady beat provided by the kotsuzumi.</p>

  <p>Although the vocal part is non-congruent, it is not entirely detached from the the strict percussion part. The actor uses the ōtsuzumi’s <em>chon</em> stroke on the third beat to position his declamation, thus a rallentando controlled by the kotsuzumi is often performed shortly before the third beat.</p>

  <p>For the most part, a complete sentence fits in the eight beats that separate two consecutive chon strokes. Longer sentences are spread over three or four consecutive <em>honji</em>. In that case, there is no rallentendo on the intermediate third beats, rather the ōtsuzumi fills the intermediate <em>honji</em>  with a sequence of five or six <em>chon</em> strokes.</p>
