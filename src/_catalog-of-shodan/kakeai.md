  <p>Dialogue usually between the shite and the waki, the <em>kakeai</em>  starts in prose and concludes with unmetered sung verse in <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori"><em>sashinori</em></a>. The text corresponding to the switch of the mode of delivery is often emphasized. If included, the material of the two hand-percussion instruments is set in flexible rhythm.</p>

  <p>Delivery in <a href="/music/voices#Spoken"><em>kotoba</em></a> is recognizable by the declamation's rising tone, identified in the video with bold syllables. On the other hand,the vibrato associated with the singing mode helps identify the switching point between the two modes.</p>

  <p>Between the two plays there are three <em>kakeai</em>, one in Hashitomi and two in Kokaji. Hashitomi’s <em>kakeai</em> is scored for two actors without accompaniment, as it opens the first act’s ‘Dialogue’ part. At this point in the play, the shite who is standing at the second pine on the bridge, has just completed his entrance chant. The waki who is kneeling at Square 5, is performing a flower mass for Buddha. It is in <em>kotoba</em> mode that he expresses his surprise when noticing a white flower among his lot that he cannot name.
It is the shite who identifies the flower as <em>iugao</em>. His  reply in singing mode rather than in <em>kotoba</em> brings emphasis to his words and more specifically to the flower’s name <em>iugao</em>, translated as ‘evening flower’. This is important since the shite personifies Lady Yūgao, whose real name is unknown. Her fictive name Lady Yūgao refers to the fact that it is through an ‘evening flower’ exchanged on a scented fan that she met Hikaru Genji with whom she had a short yet passionate affair.
As they engaged in a conversation, the waki, staying in singing mode, ask the shite to identify herself. At this point, the shite’s switch of mode from singing to <em>kotoba</em> emphasizes her refusal to divulge her name. Yet, she cannot help but provide an important clue on her identity when she states that “I have come from the flower’s shadow”.</p>

    <p>Kokaji’s first <em>kakeai</em> is written for two actors accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments. It opens the First act’s ‘Shite exits’ part and sits between two congruent <em>shōdan</em> set in <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori"><em>hiranori</em></a>: the <em>kuse</em> and the third <em>ageuta</em>.</p>

    <p>Kokaji’s second <em>kakeai</em> is written for two actors accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments. It opens the Second act’s ‘Shite exits’ part and also sits between two congruent <em>shōdan</em>: the third <em>noriji</em> set in <a href="/music/voices#Onori"><em>ōnori</em></a> and the <em>kiri</em> set in <a href="/music/voices#Chunori"><em>chūnori</em></a>.</p>
