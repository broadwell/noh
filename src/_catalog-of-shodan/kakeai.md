  <p>Dialogue usually between the shite and the waki, the <em>kakeai</em>  starts in prose and concludes with unmetered sung verse in <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori"><em>sashinori</em></a>. The text corresponding to the switch of the mode of delivery is often emphasized. If included, the material of the two hand-percussion instruments is set in flexible rhythm.</p>

  <p>Delivery in <a href="/music/voices#Spoken"><em>kotoba</em></a> is recognizable by the declamation's rising tone, identified in the video with bold syllables. On the other hand,the vibrato associated with the singing mode helps identify the switching point between the two modes.</p>

  <p>Between the two plays there are three <em>kakeai</em>, one in Hashitomi and two in Kokaji. Hashitomi’s <em>kakeai</em> is scored for two actors without accompaniment, as it opens the first act’s ‘Dialogue’ part. At this point in the play, the waki who is performing a flower mass for Buddha, notices a white flower among his lot, and wonders about it. The switch from <em>kotoba</em> to singing brings emphasis on the flower’s name <em>iugao</em>, translated as ‘evening flower’, alluding to Lady Yūgao who had a short yet passionate affair with Hikaru Genji. Yet, the return to <em>kotoba</em> emphasizes the shite's refusal to divulge her name, providing yet a clue when stating that “I have come from the flower’s shadow”, referring to the ‘evening face’.</p>

    <p>Kokaji’s first <em>kakeai</em> is written for two actors accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments. It opens the First act’s ‘Shite exits’ part and sits between two congruent <em>shōdan</em> set in <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori"><em>hiranori</em></a>: the <em>kuse</em> and the third <em>ageuta</em>.</p>

    <p>Kokaji’s second <em>kakeai</em> is written for two actors accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments. It opens the Second act’s ‘Shite exits’ part and also sits between two congruent <em>shōdan</em>: the third <em>noriji</em> set in <a href="/music/voices#Onori"><em>ōnori</em></a> and the <em>kiri</em> set in <a href="/music/voices#Chunori"><em>chūnori</em></a>.</p>
