  <p>Usually a Dialogue between the shite and the waki, the <em>kakeai</em>  starts in prose and concludes with unmetered sung verse in <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori" target="_blank"><em>sashinori</em></a>. The text corresponding to the switch of the mode of delivery is often emphasized. If included, the two hand-percussion instruments are set in flexible rhythm.</p>

  <p>Delivery in <a href="/music/voices#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a> is recognizable by the declamation's rising tone, identified in the video with bold syllables. On the other hand,the vibrato associated with the singing mode helps identify the switching point between the two modes.</p>

  <p>Between the two plays there are three <em>kakeai</em>, one in Hashitomi and two in Kokaji. Hashitomi’s <em>kakeai</em> is scored for two actors without accompaniment, as it opens the First act’s ‘Dialogue’ part. At this point in the play, the shite who is standing at the second pine on the bridge, has just completed his entrance chant. The waki who is kneeling at <a href=“/staging/stage#Squares” target="_blank">Square 5 </a>, is performing a flower mass for Buddha. It is in <em>kotoba</em> mode that he expresses his surprise when noticing among his lot a white flower that he cannot name.
  When the shite identifies the flower as <em>iugao</em>, his reply is in singing mode rather than in <em>kotoba</em>. Doing so brings emphasis to the words and more specifically to the flower’s name <em>iugao</em>, translated as ‘evening flower’. This is important since the shite personifies Lady Yūgao, whose real name is unknown. Her fictive name refers to the fact that it is through an ‘evening flower’ exchanged on a scented fan that she met Hikaru Genji with whom she had a short yet passionate affair.
  As they engaged in a conversation, the waki, staying now in singing mode, asks the woman to identify herself. At this point, she switches mode back to <em>kotoba</em> to emphasize her refusal to divulge her name. Yet, she cannot help but provide an important clue on her identity when she states that “I have come from the flower’s shadow”.</p>

    <p>Kokaji’s first <em>kakeai</em> is written for two protagonists accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments. It opens the First act’s ‘Shite exits’ part and is positioned between two congruent <em>shōdan</em> set in <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori" target="_blank"><em>hiranori</em></a>: the <em>kuse</em> and the third <em>ageuta</em>.</p>

    <p>Kokaji’s second <em>kakeai</em> is also written for two protagonists accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments. It opens the Second act’s ‘Shite exits’ part and is also positioned between two congruent <em>shōdan</em>: the third <em>noriji</em> set in <a href="/music/voices#Onori"protagonists><em>ōnori</em></a> and the <em>kiri</em> set mainly in <a href="/music/voices#Chunori" target="_blank"><em>chūnori</em></a>.</p>
