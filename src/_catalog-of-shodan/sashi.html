  <p>There are three types of <em>sashi</em> : The one that sits between the <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/issei-music" target="_blank"><em>issei</em>-music</a> and <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/issei-chant" target="_blank"><em>issei</em>-chant</a> that the shite sings after his entry; the one that leads into a <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori" target="_blank"><em>hiranori</em></a> chant. Sung in the middle range it often leads to a <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/sageuta" target="_blank"><em>sageuta</em></a>; and finally the one members of the tripartite <em>kuse</em>: <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/kuri" target="_blank"><em>kuri</em></a>, <em>sashi</em>, <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/kuse" target="_blank"><em>kuse</em></a>. Kokaji’s <em>sashi</em> is an example from the latter. </p>

<p>Based on <a href="/text/#Arhythmic" target="_blank">arhythmic</a> poetic text, all <em>sashi</em> are sung in recitative <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori" target="_blank"><em>sashinori</em></a> style by actor(s), jiutai, or alternatively, by actor(s) and jiutai. In contrast to <a href="/music/voices#Einori" target="_blank"><em>einori</em></a> chant and its prolongation of certain syllables and use of the rise and fall of the vocal line, a <em>sashinori</em> chant is akin to a recitative. The non-congruent vocal line, in alternating verses of seven and five syllables and the percussion part in flexible rhythm suggest that the text is still in the descriptive rather than poetic part of the play. The addition of the non-congruent nohkan part contributes to create a rather complex texture. In this context, it is the percussionists’ responsibility to adapt their sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns to the chant, whose tempo is in constant flux.</p>



  <p>The <em>sashi</em> from Kokaji is sung in <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin" target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a> style. It is set for one actor (shite) and the jiutai accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments and the nohkan. The shite’s two verses divide the shōdan in two parts. His first verse is followed by six lines delivered by the jiutai, each one sung on a single accelerating pitch that comes to a concluding sustained-tone. Accompanied by the nohkan’s <em>kuse no ryō</em> pattern, the jiutai’s reply to the shite’s second verse has a definite melodic quality that contrasts with the recitative quality of its preceding six lines.</p>
