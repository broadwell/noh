    <h3>À propos</h3>

<p>Intermedia form their expression by drawing on relationships between arts. Typically they combine two or more layers such as spoken or sung text, acting, visual staging, costume, movement, dance and music. Diverse and powerful examples can be found across epochs and cultures: Wayang Kulit, Kunqu, Wagner’s operas, Fluxus Happenings, MTV or Bollywood, to name a few.  Noh is one of the most elaborate, refined and oldest among them. Over five centuries it developed a fascinating and unique system of intermedia expression that this project attempts to elucidate.</p>
<p>
The Internet format felt ideal for this undertaking for two reasons. Firstly, because of its capacity to include audiovisual examples. We considered it imperative that to explain intermedia we need to quote intermedia. The readers have therefore access to an extensive set of video illustrations with elements of Noh as well as two full plays. All materials were recorded especially for the project with the intent to offer relative completeness of coverage.</p>
<p>
Secondly, the non-linearity of presentation and interactivity gives the intermedia material a chance to be shown from multiple angles ‘simultaneously’ mirroring its heterogenous nature. It enables also exploration in a more intuitive and personal way that fits the experience and interest of the readers. The project is open-ended also by necessity. Complete and conclusive analysis would not have been possible. Just to discuss the impact of music, one should address fluctuations in tempo, rhythmic organization, pitch motion and range, styles of delivery and more. Accounting for all expressive dimensions in all media and analyzing the complete network of intermedia relationships would be overwhelmingly complex. Some prioritizing stemmed from our particular interests and background in composition and musicology. Incidentally, as will be explained later in a  <a href="/about-intermedia/#abstraction">section about abstraction</a> , Noh is also constructed in a way that invites substantial sense-making by the viewers.</p>
<p>
The appreciation of a theater work can be increased by following its anticipated form and style of performance. Both are highly codified in Noh so an informed viewer can recognize them even within an unfamiliar play. To help our readers orient themselves and build useful expectations, we have developed visual representations of each play’s structure using an <a href="/about-intermedia/#intermedia-tools">Intermedia Texture Index</a> (ITI).  Its formula integrates information from multiple layers into a single graph, which is intentionally reductive.  To ground the viewers’ expectations in a more detailed way, the website offers also intermedia ‘scores’ by sections (<em>shōdan</em>). The viewers can see notation for a set of intermedia layers, or make a selection among them to shift focus according to need.</p>
<p>
The style of performance is also intermedia in nature. Each of the layers is performed with inflections appropriate for a given play, role or circumstance. To define these styles and their expressive range we use comparisons. The two plays or their standard sections are frequently interlinked. Noh is original in that contrasting characters can use the same basic musical and dance patterns. We demonstrate the sometimes very subtle differences in expression by providing  side-by-side comparisons of basic elements as they are used in diverging contexts. In performing arts in general but in Noh in particular it is not just the “what” but very much the “how” that matters.</p>
<p>
Studying Noh as intermedia invites the creation of a space-time matrix of analysis.  One needs to look at the relationships between different layers as well as in many time-frames. The number of and balance between active layers can change for a moment or a section. Analytical comments can be made also about acts and the play as a whole. To be able to provide an overall perspective that takes account of all active layers it is often useful to spend some time focusing on a subset of layers, for example, just the musical or the choreographic setting of the text. When discussing a section it is frequently informative to see it in the context of the previous and following sections as well.</p>
<p>
Our site uses different menus and pages to make the structure of the comprehensive intermedia analyses more accessible.  If hoping to discover Noh from a bottom-up view, one can start by reading introductions to individual layers and their building blocks. Their expressive possibilities and the standard construction of formal sections (<em>shōdan</em>) are provided through the <a href="/elements" target="_blank">Elements of Noh menu</a>. The analyses from the level of particular shōdan down to detailed ‘line-by-line’ observations are found in <a href="/hashitomi/ageuta-1/" target="_blank">Plays/[Title of play]/Sections</a>. A larger scale analysis from the level of full play down to dan (a sequences of shōdan that serve common dramatic purposes) is offered under <a href="/hashitomi/" target="_blank">Plays/[Title of play]/Play</a>.  Finally, the highest top-down view of intermedia follows <a href="/about-intermedia/#noh-as-intermedia">below</a>.</p>


    <h3 id="intermedia-tools">Tools of Intermedia Analysis</h3>
    <p>It is a common practice in the context of formal analysis of Noh plays to refer to Zeami's adaptation of the Gagaku concept of Jo-ha-kyū, where structural modules (<em>shōdan</em>) are grouped in sub-sets to fit within the following five-part scheme:</p>

    <table class="content-table">
      <tr class="content-table__row">
        <td class="content-table__column">Jo</td>
        <td class="content-table__column">Ha-Jo</td>
        <td class="content-table__column">Ha-Ha</td>
        <td class="content-table__column">Ha-Kyū</td>
        <td class="content-table__column">Kyū</td>
        </tr>
        </table>
  <p>  While we recognize the importance of this formal concept in Zeami's work, it is too limiting for the analysis of the intermedia structure of a Noh play.
    Hence, we developed a method of analysis that is primarily based on perception that aims at showing how the form of a play is articulated through the interaction between its text, music, and dance.</p>
    <p>Considering that the development of each media throughout the course of a Noh play is more or less prescribed, we ranked all the possible combinations between text, music and dance, where earlier stages of development were assigned a lower rank whereas higher one where given to combinations involving later stages of development. The defintion of the ranking system went through a five step process.</p>
    <h4>Step one: Transformation of each media component</h4>
    <p>First, we looked at the transformation of each media component over the course of a play, understanding that the development of each one is more or less prescribed.  For example, at the beginning of a play, the 'chant' is often spoken, presented by a single actor, the waki. Its content is more or less factual, providing the audience with information about his identity, where he comes from, where he is going, and why. A solo song or a set of solo songs often follow this introduction. Next, the entrance of the shite often leads to a return to spoken dialogue but this time between the two actors. The songs that typically follow this dialogue involves the chorus with duos that are usually more poetic and abstract in nature as to preserve the mystery around the shite’s identity, that is at least until the second act when the veil around his identity is usually lifted.</p>
    <p>Understanding that the meaning of the words can be reinforced or modulated depending on context, which is set or affected by the instrumental accompaniment; the rhythmic relationship between text and music; the motion on stage, we also looked at the overall transformation of the music and dance over the course of a play, which is also loosely predetermined. In the course of a play, the treatment of the text, music, dance, and the use of space evolve according to the unfolding story. A summary of each component’s generic transformation through the course of a play is listed below. It is important to view this information as reference model rather than strict and absolute trajectories:</p>
    <p>Text:      It changes from unmetered narrative prose to metered poetry.
    Chant:   It changes from spoken solo, to singing solo, to spoken dialogue, and finally to singing dialogue.
    Music:  It changes from non-congruent to congruent.
    Space:   It changes from a limited use of it, to a quiet dance that starts expanding the use of the stage-space, to a longer dance that is more extensive in its use of stage-space with intensified movements involving the fan and sleeves.</p>
    <h4>Step two: Transformation of the rhythmic organization of the each media component</h4>
    <p>Second, we looked at the transformation of the rhythmic organization of each media component over the course of a play. Once again we noticed prescribed transformations.  The figure below shows the generic rhythmic changes of each component over the duration of a play.</p>
    <p>The rhythmic organization of the voice moves in waves from spoken solo to non-congruent singing, from spoken duo to congruent singing set in hira-nori. In the second act, it moves from non-congruent singing to congruent singing set this time in either ônori or chûnori. The rhythmic organization of the percussion instruments tends to follow the voice's, starting each act in non-congruent moving to congruent. On the other hand, the nohkan's rhythmic organization is non-congruent almost throughout a play, switching to congruent when accompanying the 'pure' dance.</p>
    <p>Typically a Noh play will include two if not three dances. The symbol ’ √ ’ indicates where one can be expected. The 1)  √   and 3)  √  are usually a dance-to-text section. In this case, the dance supports the text by mimicking the described action. The 2)  √  is the crown jewel of a play: the ‘pure’ dance. Because of the absence of a text, this dance is more abstract.  But also because of the absence of text, the dance is the sole foreground material in this section; hence it is often grander than the other two.
    It is important to view this information as a reference model rather than strict and absolute trajectories. The analysis of the plays found on this website will help illustrate this point since they both, in their own way, deviate from this model.</p>
    <h4>Step three: Ranking basic media components based on stage of development</h4>
    <p>Keeping in mind that our ultimate goal was to rank all possible combinations between text, music and dance, we then considered the overall transformation of each component throughout a play, differentiating between earlier and latter stage of development. This is how we determine the following orders: singing over speaking, congruent over non-congruent, in the context of congruent music: ô-nori / chû-nori over hiranori,  danced section over one without dance, and in the context of a danced section: 'Pure' dance over Dance-to-text. Other considerations included:</p>
    <p>The nohkan solo with its free rhythm and the fact that it does not participate to the unfolding of the story since it has no text, was assigned the starting level.</p>
    <p>Because the text of a vocal part contributes to the unfolding of the story, it was given a higher order than the two-hand drums solo.</p>
    <p>A texture with a larger instrumentation was ranked higher over a smaller one.
    The ‘pure’ dance being the crown jewel of most plays was selected as the highest ranked texture.</p>
    <p>The figure below summarizes the hierarchies that we established:</p>
    {% include image.html src="/assets/images/New-Rhythmic-Organization-2.png" %}
    <h4>Step four: Assignment of ranked position for the textures</h4>
    <p>Fourth, we defined the texture of a section (shôdan) in terms of its instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and if it includes a dance or not. Considering all possible sections (shôdan), we identified twenty-three textures. We ranked the textures from the simplest to the optimal, as summarized in the following figure (Note that a vocal part marked with the number 2 implies a duo either between two actors, or between the chorus and an actor):</p>
    {% include image.html src="/assets/images/New-Rhythmic-Organization-1.png" %}

    <h4>Step five: Assignment of hierarchical position for the textures found in three Noh plays</h4>
    <p>Fifth, we based our analysis of the form of a Noh play on the evolution of the textures of its sections (shôdan). Although we moved away from a formal analysis based on the Jo- ha- kyû concept and developed a method of analysis that is primarily based on perception, we still used Zeami's formal design but only as a reference model and as a point of comparison.
    The two plays showcased on this website are Hashitomi (category 3) and Kokaji (category 5).  The former has 19 sections (shôdan), the latter has 20. We compared their structure with Izutsu's, a play written by Zeami that epitomizes his model structure.  When combining these three plays, we found that they include examples of twenty out of the possible twenty-three textures. It is these twenty textures that we have used when plotting the form of each play.</p>

<h3 id="noh-as-intermedia">Noh as Intermedia</h3>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of Noh is how it is put together as intermedia. It is somewhat of a paradox. Despite significant independence of media layers they cohere to a great expressive unity. To help explain what is behind this artistic feat, several guiding principles can be identified. Not surprisingly, several can be traced back to the general context in which Noh came to being – the culture of the samurai, Japanese Buddhism and Chinese philosophy. But it is a great testament to the ingenuity of Noh artists that while engaging deeply with ideals of their time they created an art that is timeless.
</p>
<h4 id="breath">
The Breath of Yin and Yang
</h4>
<p>
Literally and metaphorically, ‘breath’ is one of the primary unifying elements of Noh. It is the central model for the form. The recurring cycle of inhaling/building-up energy and exhaling/releasing it, can be found underlying the flow of Noh on all structural levels. One could visualize Noh as a fractal design with ‘breath’ as its basic element. It repeats over and over in every possible time-scale and layer to create an infinitely complex highly self-similar form. Conceptually, ‘breath’ can also be seen as reflecting the ancient Chinese philosophical tradition that describes the world as a constant balancing of Yin (dark, moon, female, inhale) and Yang (bright, sun, male, exhale). According to this philosophy, the two seemingly contrary forces are complementary, inseparable and depend on each other.
</p>
<p>
Breath is foundational for noh actors. In most literal way they develop a special kind of lower abdomen (<em>hara</em>) breathing that is similar to that of Japanese martial artists. They learn that precise control of breath is essential to convey appropriate expression of the chant as well as posture and movement of the body. It underlies the rhythm of kata. From the basic walking step to circling around the stage with a group of kata, they follow the energetic and spatial shape of a breath. </p>
<p>
Mastering breath is crucial for the drummers as well. One kind of breath is very particular. <em>Komi</em> is a silent breath that starts drumming patterns. (Examples to be illustrated with pop-up excerpts) It consists of a sharp rhythmic inhale and holding it deep in the abdomen for a while. After the build-up of internal energy through a <em>komi</em> a vocal call breaks the silence and leads to a release through a strike. The pairing of a <em>kakegoe</em> shout that introduces a drum-hit is ubiquitous in Noh and can be viewed as an Yin and Yang pattern of its own. </p>
<p>
On slightly higher formal level of the eight-beat honji, a common oscillation exists between the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi. Ōtsuzumi leads in the first half of the honji and is answered by the kotsuzumi in the second half. On the next level, when looking at the construction of a shōdan, there is often an alternation of sparse, rhythmically flexible <em>mitsuji</em> patterns with the more dense and decisive <em>tsuzuke</em>. Following the same ‘breath’ model a typical short shōdan involves gradual acceleration of rhythm and a build-up that leads in the second half to a resolution sometimes accompanied by an entrance of the nohkan (sashi of Kokaji) that ends in a brief slowdown.  Longer and more complex shōdan may consist of more than one ‘breath’. The principal sections of a jonomai dance called dan, hold within them a special moment of significant deceleration called oroshi. Musicians talk about it as of a ‘stream reaching a pond.’ These slowdowns apply not just to music but also to dance, which at that time halt to a standstill.
</p>
<p>
The typical energetic trajectory of a large-scale dan (group of shōdan in an act) matches the same pattern: gradual extended acceleration and build-up followed by a fast closure with a short but palpable slow-down. Often, this maps also onto a pattern, in which the earlier parts of the dan use more prose recitation and non-congruent chanting while the later ones involve more poetry and congruent chant. Further, even each of the two acts creates its own gradual build-up that resolves with a fast movement that closes with a slowdown. The play as a whole also shows the same pattern with the second act raising the tempo and energy further beyond the first, reaching the most cohesive section and closing with an ‘exhale’.   </p>
<p>

The need for balancing Yin and Yang aspects in performance dictates that characters or situations that represent one aspect must also offer the other. A common instruction states: ‘in rain, be bright; during the day, be calm.’ As UDAKA Tastushige told us (in an interview), ‘you should imagine that you are dancing even if you are sitting still.’ ‘You should be filling up like an ocean before it breaks out.’ Emotion need to be controlled. Anger has to be balanced by gentleness or it will portray violence. On a deeper level the mastering of breath, and Yin and Yang, helps noh actors express yūgen, the highly valued mysterious quality of hinting at the most subtle, at what lies below the surface. </p>
<h4 id="fluidity">

Fluidity of Time, Space and Identity
</h4>
<p>
Striving for a Yin and Yang equilibrium is also one of the causes that all in Noh is always fluid and gradual. The timing of events within individual layers as well as synchronization between them is in large parts intuitive and flexible. Regular and shared beats are reserved for certain important moments of intense focus and are arrived at smoothly, almost imperceptibly. The performers are interconnected, watch and listen to each other and maintain an intermedia flow but often without the need to synchronize strictly.
</p>
<p>
The drummers take the komi together but its duration is flexible and depends on the individual. The following beat is approximate and the kakegoe that precedes it is freely extended to match more general expressive needs. Many sections and layers of noh are in non-congruent and flexible rhythmic setting. Even when percussionist start coordinating pulse in a strict rhythmic setting  it does not mean that the chant or nohkan will join. The jonomai or maibataraki dances that see all instruments rhythmically aligning are rare and serve as a climax. But there, the dance is only loosely synchronized with the musical beat. When the musicians reach the oroshi the dancer will end up stopping entirely but there is no strict beat when that needs to happen. This is because the movement of bodies on stage is equally fluid. No gesture is angular or sudden. The kata are to be performed with maximum precision but without rigidity.
</p>
<p>
The fluidity of the aesthetic form is an ideal expression of the fluidity of content. The minimalism of staging or even lack of literal references to particular locations allows for the space to be malleable and constantly redefined. Like in Kokaji, a few hints in the text allows viewers’ imagination to adapt and turn the imperial palace into Munechika’s home, workshop or road to Inari Shrine.
</p>
<p>
Adding to the fluidity is the polyvocality of text and transfer of identity between shite, waki and jiutai. The main actor can speak as a narrator, share a description, quote a poem, enter into a dialog with other characters and deities, and communicate their inner thoughts. But their voice can be transferred too. An example of it is found at the beginning of Kokaji’s first <em>ageuta</em>. Typically, the first line of text of an <em>ageuta’s</em> is presented by the shite and then repeated. If the repetition is done by the jiutai it implies that it took over the communication of the thoughts of the main character.
</p>
<p>
Most Noh plays’ plots unfold around the identity of the shite. The audience is invited to discover who they are and empathize with them. According to Buddhist doctrine identity is an illusion and Noh is based on this premise. In mugen Noh plays, which are considered by many its artistic pinnacle, what we see could very well be a dream or illusion seen by the waki. The main character appears in the first act as a ghost hiding in the body of someone whom the waki could normally encounter in the dramatic present. By the end of first act we may learn the true identity of the original host of the spirit but when they return in the second act they remain a mere spirit (not the historic living person they once were). They are on the journey to enlightenment and like we can see in Hashitomi, they may not even know anymore whether they are a spirit of a woman or of a flower. The fluidity of expressive means discussed above, is a perfect reflection of this fluidity of identity. [In second-dan Sashi when the shite sings to herself, she does not now the same things at the beginning of the song as at the end. ]
</p>
<p>
Keeping in mind this instability of identity it is interesting to observe how it can be gradually constructed by intermedia. In Hashitomi, when the shite appears the first clue is visual. The actor wears a mask of a young elegant woman and a costume that depicts flowers along fences. The movement is graceful and slow. Since the waki has spoken of performing a mass for flowers it is equally possible that the main character is a spirit of a flower or a village woman. The text sung by the shite in Rongi gives the name Yūgao but because it is a common flower name the identity remains ambiguous. The name becomes a woman’s nickname as the play progresses. Associations with Genji’s lover Lady Yūgao are made in the story told during the kyōgen and in the following shōdan. The dance that imitates her when Genji talks about Lady Yūgao establishes the most direct connection. It is through intermedia that the richness of the identity is created.
</p>
<h4 id="abstraction">
Engaging Abstraction
</h4>
<p>
Intermedia, by immersing all senses can help imitate reality. Theatrical traditions differ though in the level of realism of representation.  Noh is strongly on the abstract side of the spectrum. Its acting is highly formalized. The actors’ face is covered with a mask that prevents them from showing any direct emotion. Their movement and dance comes from a prescribed vocabulary of aestheticized kata, only some of which are even symbolically mimetic. Their speech is recited or chanted using standardized patterns that are shared between all plays without regard to their different stories. The ‘voice’ of the protagonist is frequently separated from their body, being transferred to the jiutai. The costumes match categories of characters by defining their gender, profession, and rank, with garments, colors and patterns that are strictly prescribed by tradition. The stage props are symbolic and often limited to just one placed centrally. The music is composed from a fixed collection of rhythmic and melodic patterns that are reused within and between different plays. The text is the only element that is original for each play but even there, the language is formal, quotations from poetry are prevalent and the plot itself is minimal.
</p>
<p>
The power of Noh and the combination of all of these abstract intermedia elements is that it forces the audience to be more active, to project their thoughts and own their meaning. Similar to reading a book, when watching a Noh play one gets engrossed by artful narrative of ‘clues’ for one’s own act of imagining. The Noh mask epitomizes this projection. It allowes one to piece together the ambiguity and richness of information from multiple dimensions into it. Because Noh is about contemplation of a character the best plays and performances make the viewers attain profound empathy with the protagonist. The climax of the Noh experience is not some dramatic twist of a plot but the abstract dance with all of the musicians including the nohkan performing in rhythmic synchronicity.  When words cease, having done their part, we are left with the pure spirit, beautiful and vulnerable to our gaze. </p>
<h4 id="Kurai">
Kurai and Community
</h4>

<p>
In the world of Noh plays are given a rank, which depends on how much mastery is required to perform them.  The term used to define it, is kurai. The more demanding plays are classified as heavier or higher kurai while those for beginners lower or lighter one. Kurai is also an atmosphere and an expressive quality. A higher kurai demands more subtlety and solemnity in all aspects of performance, it uses most refined quality of mask and costume, the pitch of chant and kakegoe is lower, and the tempo of music and dance is slower. One can consider kurai an intermedia quality.
</p>
<p>
The group commitment to establish an appropriate kurai for a play inscribes itself into the larger communitarian nature of Noh. The intermedia construction and richness of Noh resulted from a group effort over centuries of development, slow reinterpratations and adjustments to take advantage of new affordances. Performers are organized into family schools. The most influential among them are the schools for the shite actors who not only play the leading roles but they also traditionally own the theaters and produce the plays. This hierarchy is reflected also in how the intermedia relationships work between the performers on stage.
</p>
<p>
The shite is a de facto director.  He dictates the tempo, expression and any adjustable aspects of the play. He may decide that if a play is performed on an Autumn evening at an outside stage where audience can watch the moon, there is no need for an extended musical introduction because a proper atmosphere is established naturally. He will then order to open the curtain for his entrance very soon after the music started. In contrast, inside a regular theater, he may give more time for music to prepare the right feeling in the audience before he enters the stage.
</p>
<p>
Still, from the point of view of actors there is a strong and sometimes very direct correlation of their actions with the music. The most important reference for the shite are the patterns of ōtsuzumi. To illustrate, at several points in the Jonomai the uchi-hanashi pattern of the otsuzumi serves as a signal to continue with the next sequence of movements. The pattern consists of a silent “tsu” on beat 8, “chon” on beat 1 and an extended kakegoe “yo” from beat 2 and half on. This can be observed in the following three examples: in the kakari section, at the point when the shite is facing front at Square 3, the pattern ‘tsu-chon’ stops the dancer while the “yo” vocal call signals him to turn left and start to walk across the stage; in the first dan, similar stop and start occurs on Square 2 leading to a large circle sequence; and in the second dan the dancer walks to the front at Square 4 and synchronizes with uchi-hanashi pattern to stop and turn to the right to walk backward.
</p>
<p>
As to the nohkan, the actors are aware of its importance in underlining emotions in crucial moments, outlining form or embellishing the music but many do not know what melodic patterns and when would be played. Unlike the attention that they give to the strokes and <em>kakegoe</em> of the ōtsuzumi they do not need to follow specific notes of the nohkan.
</p>
<p>
There is however an interesting parallel between the rhythmic flow of dance routines and that of non-congruent flute playing.  Both the nohkan phrases and sequences of kata are preceded by taking breaths. Even if not strictly synchronized, the intermittent action and resting creates a uniform energetic stream. The overlapping of nohkan patterns over adjacent dance routines creates a connection between them and a highly desired fluidity. The importance of the nohkan is summarized by UDAKA Tatsushige who stated that “If there is no nohkan playing in a <em>Kuse</em>, it is as if the peaks of the mountains were lost”. </p><p>–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</p>
<p>Noh is an intermedia art form of great expressive coherence. It breaths Yin and Yang as if in a fractal design. Through the fluidity of intermedia materials it embraces the impermanence of things and people. The abstract quality of its forms invites the audiences to engage deeply and become part of an intermedia community of Noh. </p>
