    <h2 id="Okotsu">Ōtsuzumi (hip drum) & Kotsuzumi (shoulder drum)</h2>
<p>Because the two drums almost always play together in constant alternation or in close interlocking patterns they form a sort of metainstrument. For this reason we are presenting them together.</p>
<p>There are five ōtsuzumi schools: Ōkura, Kanze, Ishii, Kadono and Takayasu. Featured TANIGUCHI Masatoshi and all ōtsuzumi examples are from the Ishii tradition. </p><p>There are four kotsuzumi schools: Ōkura, Kanze, Kō, and Kōsei. Featured HAYASHI Yamato and all kotsuzumi examples are from the Kō tradition.</p>

    <h4 id="Otsu-strokes">Strokes of the Ōtsuzumi</h4>
    <p>There are three basic sounds produced on the ōtsuzumi drum:</p>

    <p>There are four basic sounds produced on the kotsuzumi drum:</p>

<!--{% include kotsuzumi-sounds.html %}-->

    <h3 id="Kakegoe">Kakegoe</h3>
    <p>Drummers alternate strokes on the drums with shouts called <em>kakegoe</em>. The most frequently used by ōtsuzumi players are: <em>yo, ho, iya, yo-i,</em> and <em>hon-yo</em>, whereas for kotsuzumi players: <em>yo, ho, and iya</em>.</p>

    <p>The exact pronunciation of vowels as well as dynamic and melodic shape vary significantly depending on the dramatic context, school and performer. Please click below to hear examples of:</p>

    <p>Each of these calls can take individual shape depending on context. They not only help set the proper mood, they are also an important communication tool, helping the musicians coordinate acceleration and slow down. The example below is a shorter version of <em>ashirai</em> played with expression appropriate for the play Aoi no ue. It illustrates how the two percussionists use <em>kakegoe</em> to manage changes of tempo. As seen in the video the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi alternate their calls with drumming strokes. Because the ōtsuzumi player initiates patterns he has a leading role in establishing the tempo and mood but both players influence each other in creating a cumulative tempo.</p>

    <h3 id="Rhythm">Rhythmic Organization</h3>
    <p>The rhythmic organization in Noh is highly sophisticated, complex and carries immense dramatic potential. Its basic unit of time is an 8-beat measure (<em>honji</em>), which is used for all instrumental music, such as dance, entrance and exit music. It is also the basic unit of time for vocal music but in this case, it is possible to sporadically encounter measures of 2, 4, or 6 beats, used to accommodate the syllabic structure of the text. Despite this mostly fixed underlying structure, the immense flexibility of the individual beats and multiple ways of synchronization between instruments result in great rhythmic variety and expressive richness.</p>

    <p>Flexibility of pulse is the norm in Noh. The duration of each beat can be negotiated intuitively between expressive needs of all performers, one beat at time. Some beats of the eight-beat unit are extended or shrunk, predictably according to performance traditions. For instance, it is customary for the eighth beat to be extended and for beats 1, 3 and 5 to be shrunk. When the beats are shrunk the odd beat is not followed by a kakegoe. Regular pulse is almost exclusively found in dance, noriji, and some entrance music.</p>

    <p>The notion of strict synchronization between all players is also an exception rather than the norm. For instance, the first beat of the eight-beat unit, which for Western ensembles would traditionally serve as an accent and a point of rhythmic unity, in Noh is often silent. It is "performed" internally in the mind of the musicians a process referred to as <em>komi</em>. In the video showcasing strict and flexible rhythmic settings, the second, fourth and sixth beats are most of the time performed as <em>komi</em> as well. The sound that follows is timed according to an individual musician's sense of pacing. The notion of “togetherness” is not based on exact coincidence of the attack but on a cohesion of overall flow, energy, and expression. In the same spirit, most of the time the nohkan’s part is metrically independent from the percussion part and there are many instances when that is the case for the chant as well.</p>

    <h4 id="congruency">Congruency and Non-congruency</h4>
    <p>There are two types of rhythmic correlation between the voice, flute and percussion instruments. The correlation is 'congruent' when the nohkan and/or vocal parts align with the eight-beat unit(<em>honji</em>), whereas it is said to be 'non-congruent' when they do not. The former provides rhythmic stability, the latter rhythmic flexibility.</p>

    <p>In the non-congruent rhythmic setting, the degree of independence vis-à-vis the eight-beat unit varies according to the instruments:  A non-congruent vocal line is totally independent from the eight-beat unit, in the sense that it does not start or end on a specific beat, and at no time is it expected to align with a specific beat.  A non-congruent nohkan part begins and ends at some specific points often related to the text, but the music between these two points in not synchronized within the 8 beat measure. </p>

    <h4 id="strictness">Strict and Flexible</h4>
    <p>The drum parts are always connected to the eight-beat measure. We call a rhythmic setting 'strict' when the beat is relatively steady and 'flexible' when the beat is irregular. In the latter case the music is often characterized by fewer strokes, and a slower tempo. Difference between the two rhythmic settings is also accentuated by the <em>kakegoe</em>.  In strict setting the calls are centered equally between beats and have a shorter, more accented quality, In flexible setting the calls start earlier and can extend for the duration between beats. Percussion parts in a flexible rhythmic setting are performed primarily by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi since most of the music involving the taiko is strict. </p>

    <p>For comparison, a sequence of four eight-beat measures is performed in a strict and flexible setting.</p>
<p>  <a href="/music/flexible-strict"> video examples</a></p>

    <h4 id="patterns">Patterns</h4>
    <p>The percussionists’ strokes and <em>kakegoe</em> are arranged into patterns of varying duration, that can be as short as two and as long as thirty-two beats. Patterns are then sequenced to produce larger phrases. Although the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi have their own set of patterns, they usually work as a pair. Thus, when accompanying singers their individual patterns interlock and complement each other to form an single combined eight-beat pattern. The ōtsuzumi with its louder sound is usually more active within the first four of the eight beats while the softer kotsuzumi in the last four. This creates a continuous fluctuation of color and intensity. The combined patterns typically start on the upbeat leading to the first beat of the eight-beat unit (<em>honji</em>).</p>

    <p>For both instruments there are several categories of patterns of which we will cover the most prevalent two: ground and closing. The majority of ground patterns fall into two different types: <em>mitsuji</em> and <em>tsuzuke</em>.</p>

    <h5 id="Mitsuji">Mitsuji</h5>
    <p><em>Mitsuji</em> patterns are characterized by a smaller number of strokes and a degree of rhythmic ambiguity that increases the dependance on <em>kakegoe</em> to maintain cohesion.  They can be performed in strict or flexible rhythmic setting as shown in the following examples:</p>
    <p>  <a href="/music/mitsuji"> video examples</a></p>

    <h5 id="Tsuzuke">Tsuzuke</h5>
    <p><em>Tsuzuke</em> patterns are characterized by a larger number of strokes and relative rhythmic stability. The respective patterns of the two instruments spread and interlock to cover the entire eight-beat unit. They can be performed in a strict or flexible rhythmic setting, as shown in the following examples:</p>
    <p>  <a href="/music/tsuzuke"> video examples</a></p>

      <h5 id="Sequence">Mixed Sequence</h5>
    <p>The sequencing of <em>mitsuji</em> and <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns creates phrases whose rhythm moves like waves: from rhythmic ambiguity created by the sporadic attacks of the <em>mitsuji</em> patterns, to rhythmic clarity coming from the steadier <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns, and back to ambiguity with the beginning of the next phrase’s <em>mitsuji</em> patterns and so on.</p>

    <p>In this context, five observations can be made:<br>
    1.	The two percussion instruments have a large selection of <em>mitsuji</em> and <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns (well beyond the few provided examples). In our narrative, we have used these terms broadly: <em>mitsuji</em>, for an eight-beat measure (honji) articulated with a limited number of strokes; and <em>tsuzuke</em> for a <em>honji</em> articulated typically with one stroke per beat.<br>
    2.	Rhythmic phrases always begin with a <em>mitsuji</em> pattern leading to a <em>tsuzuke</em>, which itself either leads to a cadential pattern or to another phrase: <em>mitsuji</em> – <em>tsuzuke</em> sequence.<br>
    3.	The ratio <em>mitsuji</em> to <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns of a phrase affects its overall rhythmic stability. Phrases with a larger proportion of <em>mitsuji</em> patterns have a higher degree of rhythmic ambiguity, while phrases that have a larger proportion of <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns have a higher degree of rhythmic stability.<br>
    4.	The degree of rhythmic stability/ambiguity of a phrase is also impacted by its rhythmic setting where a strict setting is more stable than a flexible one. <br>
    5.	 The sparse <em>mitsuji</em> patterns are usually used to accompany a chant set in the declamatory <a href="/music/voices#Mitsuji-utai"><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a>. Hence the limited number of percussion strokes is counter-balanced by the melodic line unfolding with little or no rests. On the other hand, the regular <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns are usually used to accompany a chant set in the <a href="/music/voices#Tsuzuke-utai"><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a>, where syllables held over to accommodate the measure’s eight beats, creates rest in the melodic line that are counter-balanced by the steady percussion strokes.</p>

    <p>The following two videos show strict and flexible setting of a mixed sequence. Each version begins with four repetitions of a <em>mitsuji</em> pattern followed by one <em>tsuzuke</em>.</p>

    <h5 id="Uchikiri">Uchikiri pattern</h5>
    <p><em>Uchikiri</em> pattern is often used as a bridge to reestablish a strict rhythmic setting after a flexible section (<em>shōdan</em>) or after a very slow strict one. Hence, it often leads to modules with a strict rhythmic setting such as <em>ageuta</em>, <em>kuse</em>, or <em>sageuta</em>. It is easily recognizable by the ōtsuzumi player’s <em>kakegoe</em>  <em>"ha hon yo"</em>. In this video, the excerpt is extended to include the first beat of the following phrase.</p>

    %}
    <h5 id="Entrance">Entrance and Dance music</h5>
    <p>When performing dances, noriji and some entrance music, the complementarity between the two hand drums is maintined despite the fact that they perform patterns of different length. This is demonstrated in the following excerpts from the dance <em>jo no mai</em>.
    In this example the kotsuzumi’s <em>nagaji</em> pattern is spread over sixteen-beats against the ōtsuzumi's <em>ji</em> pattern that lasts eight-beat.  </p>
    <p> Kotsuzumi's <em>nagaji</em> sixteen-beat pattern:</p>
    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Kotsuzumi-Nagaji.png" %}

    <p>Ōtsuzumi's <em>ji</em> eight-beat pattern:</p>
    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Otsuzumi-Ji.png" %}

    <p>Another interesting point demonstrated with this example, is how the ōtsuzumi's closing (<em>shikake</em>) pattern brakes the predictability of the repeated patterns. Its steady six strokes and subsequent kakegoe announce the end of the dance and initiate a cadential deccelerando.</p>
