    <h2 id="Okotsu">Ōtsuzumi (hip drum) & Kotsuzumi (shoulder drum)</h2>
<p>In the Noh tradition the two drums almost always play together in a constant altenration pattern. </p>
<p>There are five ōtsuzumi schools: Ōkura, Kanze, Ishii, Kadono and Takayasu. Featured TANIGUCHI Masatoshi and all ōtsuzumi examples are from the Ishii tradition. </p><p>There are four kotsuzumi schools: Ōkura, Kanze, Kō, and Kōsei. Featured HAYASHI Yamato and all kotsuzumi examples are from the Kō tradition.</p>

    <h3 id="Otsu-strokes">Strokes of the Ōtsuzumi</h3>
    <p>There are three basic sounds produced on the ōtsuzumi drum:</p>

    <h3 id="Kotsu-strokes">Strokes of the Kotsuzumi</h3>

    <p>There are four basic sounds produced on the kotsuzumi drum:</p>

    <h3 id="Kakegoe">Kakegoe</h3>
    <p>Drummers alternate strokes on the drums with shouts called <em>kakegoe</em>. The most frequently used <em>kakegoe</em> by ōtsuzumi players are: <em>yo, ho, iya, yo-i,</em> and <em>hon-yo</em>, whereas the ones most commonly used by kotsuzumi players are: <em>yo, ho, and iya</em>.</p>

    <p>The ōtsuzumi’s <em>kakegoe</em> <em>iya</em> and <em>yo-i</em> are used to mark endings of a sections so they are not very much impacted by the rhythmic setting. <em>Hon-yo</em> is a call that introduces a section in strict setting so it is relatively consistent as well.</p>

    <p>The exact pronunciation of vowels as well as dynamic and melodic shape vary significantly depending on the dramatic context, school and performer. Please click below to hear examples of:</p>

    <p>Each of these calls can take individual shape depending on context. They not only help set the proper mood, they are also an important communication tool, helping the musicians synchronize, accelerate and slow down. The example below is a shortest version of <em>ashirai</em> played with expression appropriate for the play Aoi no ue. It illustrates how the two percussionists use <em>kakegoe</em> to communicate changes of tempo. As seen in the video the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi alternate there calls with drumming strokes. Because the ōtsuzumi player initiates patterns he has a leading role in establishing the tempo and mood but both players influence each other in creating a cumulative tempo trajectory.</p>

    <h3 id="Patterns">Rhythm: An Introduction</h3>
    <p>The rhythmic organization in Noh is highly sophisticated, complex and carries immense dramatic potential. Its basic unit of time is an 8-beat measure (<em>honji</em>), which is used for all instrumental music, such as dance, entrance and exit music. It is also the basic unit of time for vocal music but in this case, it is possible to sporadically encounter measures of 2, 4, or 6 beats, used to accommodate the syllabic structure of the text. Despite this mostly fixed underlying structure, the immense flexibility of the individual beats and multiple ways of synchronization between instruments result in great rhythmic variety and expressive richness.</p>

    <p>Flexibility of pulse is the norm in Noh. The duration of each beat can be negotiated intuitively between expressive needs of all performers, one beat at time. Some beats of the eight-beat unit are extended or shrunk, predictably according to performance traditions. For instance, it is customary for the eighth beat to be extended. Regular pulse is almost exclusively found in dance and some entrance music.</p>

    <p>The notion of strict synchronization between all players (referred to in Noh as congruency) is also an exception rather than the norm. For the percussionists the first beat of the eight-beat unit, which for Western ensembles would traditionally serve as an accent and a point of rhythmic unity, in Noh is often silent. It is "performed" internally in the mind of the musicians and followed by a note according to an individual's sense of pacing. The notion of “togetherness” is not based on exact coincidence of the attack but on a cohesion of energy and expression. In the same spirit, most of the time the nohkan’s part is metrically independent from the percussion part and there are many instances when that is the case for the chant as well.</p>

    <h3 id="congruency">Congruent/Non-congruent</h3>
    <p>There are two types of rhythmic correlation between the voice, flute and percussion instruments. The rhythmic correlation is said to be congruent when the nohkan and/or vocal part align with the eight-beat unit(<em>honji</em>), whereas it is said to be non-congruent when they do not.</p>

    <p>When performing in a congruent setting the unit's eight beats are 'relatively' periodic with the exception to the duration of the 8th beat, which is usually slightly extended, hence this setting provides rhythmic stability.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, when performing in a non-congruent setting the unit's eight beats are not equidistant. The duration of the 1st, 3rd and/or 5th beat can be shortened and the 8th one slightly extended. Also, the tempo is usually slower than in congruent setting, thus providing flexibility to prolong or shorten the duration of the beats.</p>

    <p>In the non-congruent rhythmic setting, the degree of independence vis-à-vis the eight-beat unit varies according to the instruments:
    •	A non-congruent vocal line is totally independent from the eight-beat unit, in the sense that it does not start or end on a specific beat, and at no time is it expected to align with a specific beat.
    •	A non-congruent nohkan part begins and ends at some specific points usually related to the text, but the music between these two points in not synchronized within the 8 beat measure.
    •	Finally, a drum part is always connected to the eight-beat measure. Thus, we call a rhythmic setting strict, when the beat is relatively steady. On the other hand, we call a rhythmic setting flexible when the beat is irregular, in which case the music is often characterized by fewer strokes. Percussion parts with a flexible rhythmic setting is performed primarily by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi  since most of the music involving the taiko is strict. Difference between the two rhythmic settings is also accentuated by the <em>kakegoe</em>.  In strict setting the calls are centered equally between beats and have a shorter, more accented quality, whereas in flexible setting the calls start earlier and extend for the duration between beats.</p>

    <p>For comparison sake, a sequence of four eight-beat measures is performed in a strict and flexible setting.</p>

<p>  <a href="/music/flexible-strict"> video examples</a></p>
    <h3>Rhythmic Organization and Patterns</h3>
    <p>The percussionists’ strokes and <em>kakegoe</em> are arranged into patterns of varying duration, that can be as short as two and as long as thirty-two beats. Patterns are then sequenced to produce larger phrases. All three instruments have their own set of patterns but there is a very important relationship between the kotsuzumi and ōtsuzumi, who most of the time work as a pair. Whenever they accompany singers their individual patterns interlock and complement each other to form an eight-beat pattern. The ōtsuzumi with its louder sound is usually more active within the first four of the eight beats while the softer kotsuzumi in the last four. This creates a continuous fluctuation of color and intensity. The combined patterns typically start on the upbeat leading to the first beat of the eight-beat unit (<em>honji</em>).</p>

    <p>For both instruments there are several categories of patterns of which we will cover the most prevalent: ground and closing. The majority are ground patterns fall into two different types: <em>mitsuji</em> and <em>tsuzuke</em>.</p>

    <h3 id="mitsuji">Mitsuji patterns</h3>
    <p><em>Mitsuji</em> patterns are characterized by a limited number of strokes which can lead to rhythmic ambiguity, thus increasing the importance of the <em>kakegoe</em>, which help maintained cohesion.  They can be performed in strict or flexible rhythmic setting. Here are two examples:</p>
    <p>  <a href="/music/mitsuji"> video examples</a></p>

    <h3 id="tsuzuke">Tsuzuke patterns</h3>
    <p><em>Tsuzuke</em> patterns are characterized by a larger number of strokes that provides rhythmic stability. It also allows for the sound of the two instruments to merge as their respective patterns spread over the entire eight-beat unit. It can be performed in a strict or flexible rhythmic setting, as shown with the following examples:</p>
    <p>  <a href="/music/tsuzuke"> video examples</a></p>

      <h3>Sequence of patterns</h3>
    <p>The sequencing of <em>mitsuji</em> and <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns creates phrases whose rhythm moves like waves: from rhythmic ambiguity created by the sporadic attacks of the <em>mitsuji</em> patterns, to rhythmic clarity coming from the steadier <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns, and back to ambiguity with the beginning of the next phrase’s <em>mitsuji</em> patterns and so on.</p>

    <p>In this context, five observations must be made:
    1.	The two percussion instruments have a large selection of <em>mitsuji</em> and <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns that goes well beyond the few provided examples. In our narrative, we have used these terms broadly: <em>mitsuji</em>, for an eight-beat measure (honji) articulated with a limited number of strokes; and <em>tsuzuke</em> for a <em>honji</em> articulated with practically one stroke per beat.
    2.	Rhythmic phrases always begin with a <em>mitsuji</em> pattern leading to a <em>tsuzuke</em>, which itself either leads to a cadential pattern or to another phrase: <em>mitsuji</em> – <em>tsuzuke</em> sequence.
    3.	The ratio <em>mitsuji</em> to <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns of a phrase affects its overall rhythmic stability, in the sense that phrases with a larger proportion of <em>mitsuji</em> patterns have a higher degree of rhythmic ambiguity, while phrases that have a larger proportion of <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns have a higher degree of rhythmic stability.
    4.	The degree of rhythmic stability/ambiguity of a phrase is also impacted by its rhythmic setting where a strict setting is more stable than a flexible one.
    5.	 The sparse <em>mitsuji</em> patterns are usually used to accompany a chant set in the declamatory <a href="/music/voices#Mitsujji_utai"><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a>. Hence the limited number of percussion strokes is counter-balanced by the melodic line unfolding with little or no rests. On the other hand, the regular <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns are usually used to accompany a chant set in the <a href="/music/voices#Mitsujji_utai"><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a>, where syllables held over to accommodate the measure’s eight beats, creates rest in the melodic line that are counter-balanced by the steady percussion strokes.</p>

    <p>The music in the next video is spread over five <em>honji</em>, where the first four are set in sparse <em>mitsuji</em>, the last one in steady <em>tsuzuke</em>.</p>

    <h3 id="uchikiri">Uchikiri pattern</h3>
    <p><em>Uchikiri</em> pattern is often used as a bridge to reestablish a strict rhythmic setting after a flexible module (<em>shōdan</em>) or after a very slow strict one. Hence, it often leads to modules with a strict rhythmic setting  such as <em>ageuta</em>, <em>kuse</em>, or <em>sageuta</em>. It is easily recognizable by the ōtsuzumi player’s <em>kakegoe</em>  <em>"ha hon yo"</em>. In this video, the excerpt is extended to include the first beat of the following phrase.</p>

    %}
    <h3>Entrance and Dance music</h3>
    <p>When performing dances and some entrance music, the complementarity between the two hand drums is somewhat relaxed as they perform patterns of different length that do not necessarily interlock within an eight-beat unit, as demonstrated with the following excerpts from the dance <em>jo no mai</em>.
    In this example the kotsuzumi’s <em>nagaji</em> pattern is spread over sixteen-beats against the ōtsuzumi's <em>ji</em> pattern that lasts eight-beat. The repeated patterns of the flute and two hand drums are almost hypnotic bringing them to the background and leaving the foreground to the dance.</p>
    <p> Kotsuzumi's <em>nagaji</em> sixteen-beat pattern:</p>
    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Kotsuzumi-Nagaji.png" %}

    <p>Ōtsuzumi's <em>ji</em> eight-beat pattern:</p>
    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Otsuzumi-Ji.png" %}

    <p>Another interesting point demonstrated with this example, is how the ōtsuzumi's closing <em>shikake</em> pattern brakes the predictability of the repeated patterns. Its steady six strokes and subsequent kakegoe announce the end of the dance and initiate the cadential deccelerando.</p>

    <h3 id="notation">Notation</h3>
    <p>When performing intermedia analysis of a <em>shōdan</em> on this website, we have provided summarized scores, merging the ōtsuzumi’s and kotsuzumi’s patterns into a single line.</p>

    <p>For example, the following rhythmic patterns:</p>
    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/MergingRhythms-1.png" %}
    <p>have been notated as such:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/MergingRhythms-2.png" %}

     <p>And these patterns:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/MergingRhythms-3.png" %}
     <p>have been written like this:</p>
     {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/MergingRhythms-4.png" %}

     <p>where the left strokes on the first, third and sixth beats corresponds to the ōtsuzumi’s stroke, the right ones to the kotsuzumi’s. We have followed the same sequencing when merging <em>kakegoe</em> and stroke, thus the <em>'yo''</em> on the second half of the fourth beat is called by the ōtsuzumi player at the same time as the kotsuzumi player performs a <em>pu</em> stroke.</p>

     <p>Finally, when the taiko is playing with the other two hand-drums, only its part has been notated.</p>
