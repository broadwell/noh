    <p>There are six types of actors/singers:</p>

      <td class="content-table__column">The primary actor and vocal soloist is usually masked. In some plays the shite has a companion actor called the shite tsure who can also be masked. Although the tsure can also dance, if only one is to dance it will always be the shite. The story revolves around him. At first, we usually know nothing if not very little about his true identity. Often, he is a character from another world, embodying for example a divine being or deceased person. In the latter case, (and considering that most plays are composed of two acts) the first act shite is often a spirit who has taken the form of a person, and the ghost or apparition of the same spirit in the second act.<br><br>KONGŌ Tatsunori and UDAKA Tatsushige, the shite featured in the plays are from the Kongō school.</td>

      <td class="content-table__column">The secondary actor is always a male character living in the narrative present hence he is never masked. We usually know much about him since he often introduces himself at the very beginning of a play. He engages the shite and as such provides him with a reason to appear and perform. Plays without a waki are exceptionally few. The waki is always a realistic character. There are three majors types of waki character: a shrine official or retainer; a warrior; but most commonly a traveling priest. In some plays the waki has one or few unmasked companion actors called waki tsure. <br><br>Featured in both plays, ARIMATSU Ryōichi is from the Takayasu school.</td>

During the time he changes costume to transform into the nochi-shite (second act shite) an ai-kyōgen performs the interlude between two acts. Usually not masked and a realistic character, he often provides a summary of the first act and context for the second by engaging in a discussion with the waki if he has remained on stage. <br><br>Featured in both plays, SHIME Shigeyama is from the Ōkura school.</td>

      <td class="content-table__column">It is in the early 17th century that the chorus called jiutai became a permanent stage member. Until that time, the shite and waki sung in unison the parts that constitute today's jiutai's part. The members of the group are not masked. Today's standard membership varies between 6 and 10 performers. The role of the jiutai is to keep the story going, setting the scene, describing the characters and actions.  It does not have an identity of its own, singing in unison only, it can either be a narrator or ‘speak’ for the shite or waki. Its first singing moment in a play called <em>shodō</em>, always marks an important point in the development of a play. <br><br>The members of the jiutai are always from the same school as the shite. Besides the eight-member jiutai of both plays, our academic examples feature a two-person jiutai, UDAKA Tatsushige and Norishige, all from the Kongō school.</td>

      <td class="content-table__column">Often perceived as ‘assistant’, the kōken is in fact an important non-performing performer. The shite’s kōken is typically his senior and always from the same school. His active function is to oversee all stage activity, help with on stage changing of costume when necessary, prompting in a normal voice if the shite forgets a line and handling props as required. He also has the responsibility to take over should the shite be unable to complete the performance. Sitting in the back stage-right, the kōken provides the shite with an important anchoring presence on stage.</td>

    <h2>Sound of the Voice</h2>
    <p>All vocal production in Nō is uniquely stylized and falls in two general categories: </p>
    <h3>Vocal music: Spoken</h3>
    <p>The spoken music called kotoba consists of non-rhythmical prose intoned with a full voice in a rather stylized fashion. Usually, sentences are divided into two parts: a gradual rising tone reaching a peak followed by a falling off.  Colored syllables are used in the excerpts to identify the higher pitch that triggers the following descent.</p> 
    <p>Sections in kotoba are always delivered by an actor, never by the jiutai. The difference in style between the shite's and waki's kotoba can be heard in the following examples:</p>

          <p>Kotoba delivered by a waki personating a traveling priest. The slow delivery speed in the lower register is well suited for a calm traveling priest.</p>

          <p>Video of Kokaji Nanori Inflection</p>
          <p>Kotoba performed by a waki tsure performing a messenger, hastening to deliver an important order. The fast delivery speed and use of the higher register is well suited for a messenger who is in a hurry to deliver an important message.</p>
        </section>
        <section id='Kokaji-Mondō-Inflection' title='Kokaji Mondō Inflection' class='tabbed-narrative'>
          <p>Video of Kokaji Mondō Inflection</p>
          <p>The mondō from Kokaji is a spoken dialogue between the  shite (a divine being)  and waki (sword maker). The former sits on the left, and the latter on the right. This example offers two points of comparison between the kotoba styles of shite and waki.</p>
          <p>The first point relates to the gradual rising tone. While they both use a rising line to get to a peak-tone, the overall ascent of the shite’s line is more subdued compared with the waki’s. The second point relates to the rhythm of delivery, the shite’s being much slower than the waki.</p>
          <p>These are not to be understood as universal stylistic characteristics, but rather as performance differences, the shite’s less flamboyant style being well suited to a deity. Moreover, the difference between the two styles helps setting apart the divine being from the mere human.</p>

    <h3>Vocal music: Chanted</h3>
    <p>The chanted music called utai is sung in two different styles: yowagin -  a gentler melodic singing and tsuyogin - a more forceful and dramatic one.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="tabs-container">
    <div class="tabs-container__links">

      <div class="wrapper">
        <section id='Yowagin' title='Yowagin' class='tabbed-narrative'>
          <p>When singing in yowagin style, the actor uses a modest vibrato producing melodies with clearly perceptible stable pitches. This style is used for passages expressing elegance and pathos.</p>
          <p>The ‘tonic’ of a chant in Nō is not absolute but determined by the performer, however the chant’s intervals are fixed. The entire range covers two octaves and it is divided up into four register zones: Very low, Low, Prime, and High, each one covering more or less the span of a perfect fourth.</p>
          <p>Pitches being relative they are referred to by name rather than by pitch. The three most important pitches are the Low, Medium, and High (in our example B2, E3, and A3 respectively), and the majority of the chants are set around these three pole-pitches. Intermediate pitches are used to melodically flow from one of these pole-pitches to another.</p>
          <p>Finally, the lower and higher ranges are extended with the addition of the low ryo and the ryo (E2 and F#2 respectively) for the former, and the kuri and high kuri (C4 and E4 respectively) for that later.</p>
          <p>Hagoromo -Kuri -Yowagin-Range</p>
          <p>The module is named after the pitch kuri from the higher register. For the most part, the pitch material of the piece focuses on the High pitch with few incursions on the Kuri shown with highlighted text on the video.</p>
          <p>Upon reaching the kuri’s signature cadential melisma, the hon-yuri, the pitch material switches to the Medium before cadencing on the Low. (The pitch material in this performance is a major second lower than the one shown in the Figure above).</p>
        </section>
        <section id='Tsuyogin' title='Tsuyogin' class='tabbed-narrative'>
          <p>While singing in tsuyogin style, the actor uses a notable vibrato with utterances usually contained within a small range span. This style is used for most dramatic passages such as those expressing excitement, bravery, or solemnity.</p>
          <p>The actors are not attempting to produce specific melodic pitches. Their singing oscillates mainly within a minor third shown below as Low and Medium/High tones. However, at specific moments the Medium/High tone is embellished by higher tones.</p>
          <p>Video of Kokaji -Kuri -Tsuyogin-Range</p>
          <p>The module’s name refers to the high pitch Kuri, hence the module’s melody is set in the higher register. Kokaji’s kuri includes four melodic motions towards the Kuri. They appear as part of embellishments in several words highlighted in the video with colored syllables. Except for thekuri’s signature closing melisma called hon-yuri, the pitch module’s pitch material focuses on the Medium/High tone.</p>

    <h2>Rhythmic organization</h2>
    <p>Akin to the nohkan part, the vocal part also has two categories of rhythmic organization. It is said to be congruent when its part aligns with specific beats, and <a href="#anchor-name">non-congruent</a> when it does not.</p>
    <h3 title="anchor-name">Congruent singing (au)</h3>
    <p>A Nō chant is said to be congruent when its syllables coincide with the measure’s beats. There are three possible congruent setting: hiranori, ōnori, and chūnori.</p>
