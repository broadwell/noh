    <div class="introductory-table__definition"><p>The primary actor and vocal soloist is usually masked. In some plays the shite has a companion actor called the shite tsure who can also be masked. Although the tsure can also dance, if only one is to dance it will always be the shite. </p><p>The story revolves around him. At first, we usually know nothing if not very little about his true identity. Often, he is a character from another world, embodying for example a divine being or deceased person. In the latter case, (and considering that most plays are composed of two acts) the first act shite is often a spirit who has taken the form of a person, and the ghost or apparition of the same spirit in the second act.</p><p>KONGŌ Tatsunori and UDAKA Tatsushige, the shite featured in the plays are from the Kongō school.</p></div>

    <h2>Taiko Patterns and Rhythmic Organization</h2>
    <p>At a basic level the sounds of the taiko are sequenced to create patterns. Most patterns are eight beats long and typically start on the 2nd or 6th beat of the 8-beat metric unit. However there are patterns as short as two and as long as 24 beats in duration. The patterns are sequenced into larger phrases and sections. They are selected and ordered according to various sets of rules based on their formal function. The sequencing can vary depending on a specific section. The following figure shows one example of standard categories of patterns used in dance and ô-nori chanting; and how they can be sequenced.</p>
