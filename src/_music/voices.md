Often, he is a character from another world, embodying for example a divine being or deceased person. In the latter case, (and considering that most plays are composed of two acts) the first act shite is often a spirit who has taken the form of a person, and the ghost or apparition of the same spirit in the second act.</td>

Until that time, the shite and waki sung in unison the parts that constitute today's jiutai's part. The members of the group are not masked. Today's standard membership varies between 6 and 10 performers. The role of the jiutai is to keep the story going, setting the scene, describing the characters and actions.  It does not have an identity of its own, singing in unison only, it can either be a narrator or ‘speak’ for the shite or waki. Its first singing moment in a play called <em>shodō</em>, always marks an important point in the development of a play. The members of the jiutai are always from the same school as the shite. Besides the eight-member jiutai of both plays, our academic examples feature a two-person jiutai. </td>

He also has the responsibility to take over should the shite be unable to complete the performance.

Plays without a waki are exceptionally few. There are three majors types of waki characters: a shrine official or retainer; a warrior; but most commonly a traveling priest.

        <h2 id="Sound">Vocal Sounds</h2>
        <p>The vocal production in Noh is highly stylized and falls into two general categories: spoken and chanted</p>
        <h3 id="Spoken">Spoken</h3>
        <p>
        The spoken sections called <em>kotoba</em> consist of non-rhythmical prose intoned with a full voice. Usually, sentences are divided into two parts: a gradual rising tone reaching a peak followed by a falling off.  In the text transcription of the excerpts the colored syllables are used to identify the higher pitches that lead to a descent. </p><p>
    Sections in <em>kotoba</em> are always delivered by an actor, never by the jiutai. The difference in style between the shite's and waki's kotoba can be heard in the following three examples: <br>Hashitomi/Nanori – waki <br>Kokaji/Nanori – waki tsure <br>Kokaji/Mondō – shite and waki.

While they both use a rising line to get to a peak-tone, the overall ascent of the shite’s line is more subdued compared with the waki’s.

            <h3 id="Chanted">Chanted</h3>
            <p>
    The chanted music called <em>utai</em> can be sung in two different styles: <em>yowagin</em> – a gentler melodic singing and <em>tsuyogin</em> – a more forceful and dramatic one.
            </p>

          <h4 id="Yowagin">Yowagin</h4>
            <p>
            When singing in yowagin style, the actor uses a modest vibrato producing melodies with clearly perceptible stable pitches. This style is used for passages expressing elegance and pathos.
             </p><p>
            The ‘tonic’ of a chant in Nō is not absolute but determined by the performer, however the chant’s intervals are fixed. The entire range covers two octaves and it is divided up into four register zones: Very low, Low, Prime, and High, each one covering more or less the span of a perfect fourth.
             </p><p>
            Pitches being relative they are referred to by name rather than by pitch. The three most important pitches are the Low, Medium, and High (in our example B2, E3, and A3 respectively), and the majority of the chants are set around these three pole-pitches. Intermediate pitches are used to melodically flow from one of these pole-pitches to another.
            Finally, the lower and higher ranges are extended with the addition of the low ryo and the ryo (E2 and F#2 respectively) for the former, and the kuri and high kuri (C4 and E4 respectively) for that later.

          <h4 id="Tsuyogin">Tsuyogin</h4>

            <p>While singing in tsuyogin style, the actor uses a notable vibrato with utterances usually contained within a small range span. This style is used for most dramatic passages such as those expressing excitement, bravery, or solemnity.
     </p><p>
    The actors are not attempting to produce specific melodic pitches. Their singing oscillates mainly within a minor third shown below as Low and Medium/High tones. However, at specific moments the Medium/High tone is embellished by higher tones.

        <h2 id="Rhythm"> Vocal Rhythms</h2>

        <p> The vocal parts fall into two main categories of rhythm: <em>congruent</em> when their parts align with specific beats, and <em>non-congruent</em> when they do not.</p>

        <h3 id="Congruent">Congruent (au)</h3>
        <p>A Noh chant is said to be congruent when its syllables coincide with the measure’s beats. There are three possible congruent settings: <a href="#Hiranori">hiranori</a>, <a href="#Onori">ōnori</a>, and <a href="#Chunori">chūnori</a>.</p>

        <h4 id="Hiranori">Hiranori</h4>

        <p>Verse consisting of alternating lines of -seven and five- syllables is considered to be the most lyrical and elegant form of Japanese poetry as seen in haiku, waka, and renga, among others. Hiranori is the basic rhythmic form used in Nō where the poetic twelve syllables match with the honji’s eight-beat. Considering that there is a possibility of two syllables per beat for a total of sixteen syllables per honji, this leaves space for four caesuras. There is no standard position for the caesuras, but their distribution often divides the honji in two asymmetric parts: one of four beats and a half, the other one with three beats and a half. All examples are based on Hashitomi’s first ageuta.</p>

        <p>The hiranori setting has two singing styles: <a href="#Tsuzukeutai">tsuzuke-utai</a> and <a href="#Mitsujiutai">mitsuji-utai</a>. The explanation of examples of the two individual styles is followed by a <a href="#Hiranoridemo">demonstration in the context</a> of a section where the two complement each other.</p>

        <h5 id="Tsuzuke-utai">Tsuzuke-utai</h5>

        <p>When singing in tsuzuke-utai, syllables are held over the first, third, and fifth beats, so that the twelve syllables fit within the honji (8-beat unit). In other words, the text is manipulated for the benefit of a steady metric structure, hence the eight beats of the unit are equidistant.</p>

        <p>The example below shows an academic distribution of the twelve syllables in two groups of seven and five; with the group of seven syllables broken into: 1 + 3 + 3, with the first syllable starting on the upbeat preceding the very first beat. The figure also shows that the syllables preceding the first third and fifth beats are held over the downbbeat, as if to avoid competing with the ōtsuzumi’s strong strokes that usually fall on at least one of these downbeats. The fourth caesura occurs on the eighth downbeat in order to separate the two parts.</p>

        {% include image-no-background.html
          src="/assets/images/Tsuzukeutai.jpg"
        %}

        <p>Here is a more dynamic distribution of the four caesuras, with a setting that follows the grammatical structure of the text. FOLLOWING JPG NEEDS REPLACING WITH A CORRECT ONE THAT NEEDS CORRECTING IN ITSELF </p>

          title="Hashitomi/Ageuta-1"
        %}

        <p> Occasionally, lines of text do not fit within the 7 + 5 model. As a matter of fact, the number of syllables of the first part can vary between two and ten, and between three and eight for the second part.</p>

        <p>There are two adjusting methods to accommodate such case: the first one involves shifting the beat of the text’s very first syllable, whereas the second method involves the insertion of measures of various sizes.</p>

        <p>One method of fitting a larger than twelve syllables line of text within a honji (an eight-beat unit) consist of starting the first syllable of that line on a beat earlier that the standard upbeat to the very first beat. For example, the last line of text of Hashitomi’s first ageuta is comprised of thirteen syllables: 8 + 5.</p>

        {% include image-no-background.html
          src="/assets/images/Firstmethod.jpg"

        %}
        <p> In this case, ‘Ta’ the first syllable starts on the eighth downbeat as seen below instead of the usually upbeat to the very first beat:</p>
        {% include image-no-background.html
          src="/assets/images/Firstmethod2.jpg"
        %}
        <p>Another method of fitting a larger than twelve syllables line of text within a honji (eight-beat unit) consists of introducing measures of two (okuriji), four (toriji), or six (kataji) beats. For example, here are the first three lines of Kokaji’s kiri. Its syllabic structure is: 7 + 5, 7 + 6, and 9 + 5.</p>

        {% include image-no-background.html
          src="/assets/images/Secondmethod.jpg"
        %}
        <p> A toriji (measure of four beats) has been inserted between the second and third honji (eight beat unit) in order to counter-balance the odd syllabic structure of the text. When it comes to measures other than the honji, the toriji is far more common that the two- and six-beat measures.</p>
        {% include image-no-background.html
          src="/assets/images/Secondmethod2.jpg"
        %}

        <h4 id="Mitsuji-utai">Mitsuji-utai</h4>

        <p>When singing in mitsuji-utai, syllables are rarely held over, hence the honji (8-beat unit) is condensed to fit the text. In other words, the metric structure is manipulated for the benefit of the text's declamation.  Hence, the eight beats of the unit are not equidistant.  Compared with tsuzuke-utai, a setting in mitsuji-utai is more dynamic since the melodic momentum is rarely interrupted by held-over tones.</p>

        <p>Here is the text from Hashitomi’s first ageuta set in mitsuji-utai, where the condensed first, third, and fifth beats are shown in boxes.</p>

        <h4 id="Combination">Demonstration in context of a play</h4>

        <p>In the context of a chant,  mitsuji-utai and tsuzuke-utai are used alternatively to vary and control the rhythmic flow of the chant. The changes from mitsuji-utai to tsuzuke-utai are not left at the discretion of the performers though, rather the music is entirely written out, and it typically includes back and forth transition between the two. The cycle 'mitsuji- to tsuzuke-utai' always starts with mitsuji-utai leading to tsuzuke-utai, which itself either leads to a cadential pattern or to another mitsuji-utai, to start another cycle.</p>

        <p>It is interesting to note that sparse Mitsuji patterns are usually used to accompany the part of a chant set in the declamatory mitsuji-utai, where the limited number of percussion strokes is counter-balanced by the melodic line unfolding with little or no rests. On the other hand, the regular tsuzuke patterns are usually used to accompany part of a chant set in the tsuzuke-utai, where syllables held over to accommodate the measure’s eight beats, creates rest in the melodic line that are counter-balanced by the steady percussion strokes.</p>

        <p>Here is the actual text setting for the first ageuta from Hashitomi. This chant being rather short, it includes only one motion from mitsuji-utai to tsuzuke-utai, with the first three lines set in mitsuji-utai accompanied with sparse mitsuji patterns in the percussion, and the last three in tsuzuke-utai accompanied with steady tsuzuke patterns in the percussion.</p>

        <p>The model text setting in ônori has one syllable per beat. The first syllable of each line of text usually comes on the second beat. Because of its periodic quality, this text setting is often used before or after a dance or in the concluding module (shôdan) of a play: the kiri.</p>

        <p>Text set in chūnori has two syllables per beat. The first syllable of each line of text usually comes on the first beat, with a complete line finishing within the span of a single eight-beat unit (honji).</p>

        <p>Because of its lively quality, this text setting is often used for description of an active moment, such as a battle. Although, it is common practice for a module whose text is set to chūnori to include passages set in hiranori, its eight beats are almost never contracted akin to mitsuji-utai, rather, they remain steady.</p>

        <h3 id="Non-congruent">Non-congruent (awazu)</h3>

        <p>The emphasis for non-congruent chants is on the text and melodic line. With this text setting there is no coordination between syllables and the unit’s eight beats. There are two types of non-congruent chant: <em>sashinori</em> and <em>einori</em>.</p>

        <h4 id="Sashinori">Sashinori</h4>

        <p>Sashinori chant is always accompanied by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi in a flexible setting, while einori chant can be accompanied by the hand percussion instruments in either strict or flexible setting. If the chant includes a nohkan part it will also be non-congruent.</p>

        <p>Sashinori chants are sung in a recitative style. They are usually accompanied by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi in a flexible setting, favoring the sparse mitsuji patterns. On the other hand, the Kuri also accompanied by the two hand-drums in a non-congruent setting favors the tsuzuke pattern.  There is a Japanese expression that describes well the idea behind a non-congruent chant accompanied by non-congruent percussion: fusoku furi which means ‘not separate but not together’.</p>

        <p>The sashi from Kokaji, sung in tsuyogin mode, is composed of two phrases. Each one begins by a solo performed the shite followed by a reply by the jiutai. The phrases are broken up into segments rhythmically characterized by a pulse that is very slightly accelerated before coming to a longer duration. The notes with longer duration are all positioned on words that reinforce the text's phrase structure or its meaning. For the most part, each segment stays on the high pitch which is usually preceded with an inflection from below. Finally, the chant concludes on the low tone.</p>

        <p>The provided score for this excerpt shows the first phrase composed of six segments, each one concluded by a sustained-tone : the first one presented by the shite the next six by the jiutai, identified in the score with the numbers 1 to 6. It is the two percussionists' responsibility to position their four mitsuji patterns against these seven segments.</p>

        <h4 id="Einori">Einori</h4>

        <p>Einori chants are usually accompanied by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi in a congruent setting. The issei-chant from Hashitomi is sung in yowagin style, it focuses on only four pitches:the Medium and High, and their respective  Intermediate pitch a tone lower. It is divided up into two segments: the first one sang by the shite, the second one by the jiutai.</p>

        <p>The hand-percussion instruments start both segments with sparse mitsuij  patterns before moving on with tzusuke patterns.   It is while performing the sparse mitsuji patterns that the ōtsuzumi player has some flexibility to adapt to the melodic line. This is particularly clear with this recording. One can recognized the ōtsuzumi player's use of the flexible kakegoe when performing the first mitsuji patterns, whereas the kotsuzumi player uses the strict kakegoe throughout the chant.
