    <h2>Voices</h2>
    <p>There are five types of actors/singers:</p>

    <div class="introductory-table__term">Role</div>
    <div class="introductory-table__definition">The primary actor and vocal soloist is usually masked. In some plays the shite has a companion actor called the shite tsure who can also be masked. Although the tsure can also dance, if only one is to dance it will always be the shite. The story revolves around him. At first, we usually know nothing if not very little about his true identity. Often, he is a character from another world, embodying for example a divine being or deceased person. In the latter case, (and considering that most plays are composed of two acts) the first act shite is often a spirit who has taken the form of a person, and the ghost or apparition of the same spirit in the second act.KONGŌ Tatsunori and UDAKA Tatsushige, the shite featured in the plays are from the Kongō school.</div>
    <div class="introductory-table__definition">The secondary actor is always a male character living in the narrative present hence he is never masked. We usually know much about him since he often introduces himself at the very beginning of a play. He engages the shite and as such provides him with a reason to appear and perform. Plays without a waki are exceptionally few. The waki is always a realistic character. There are three majors types of waki character: a shrine official or retainer; a warrior; but most commonly a traveling priest. In some plays the waki has one or few unmasked companion actors called waki tsure. Featured in both plays, ARIMATSU Ryôichi is from the Takayasu school.
</div>
    <div class="introductory-table__definition">Most plays are composed of two acts. The first one is usually concluded by the exit of the mae-shite (first act shite). During the time he changes costume to transform into the nochi-shite (second act shite) an ai-kyōgen performs the interlude between two acts. Usually not masked and a realistic character, he often provides a summary of the first act and context for the second by engaging in a discussion with the waki if he has remained on stage. Featured in both plays, SHIME Shigeyama is from the Ōkura school.
</div>
    <div class="introductory-table__definition">A child role. The kokata is always from the same school as the shite's.</div>
    <div class="introductory-table__definition">It is in the early 17th century that the chorus called jiutai became a permanent stage member. Until that time, the shite and waki sung in unison the parts that constitute today's jiutai's part. The members of the group are not masked. Today's standard membership varies between 6 and 10 performers. The role of the jiutai is to keep the story going, setting the scene, describing the characters and actions.  It does not have an identity of its own, singing in unison only, it can either be a narrator or ‘speak’ for the shite or waki. Its first singing moment in a play called <em>shodō</em>, always marks an important point in the development of a play. The members of the jiutai are always from the same school as the shite's. Besides the eight-member jiutai of both plays, our academic examples feature a two-person jiutai, UDAKA Tatsushige and Norishige from the Kongô school.
</div>
    <div class="introductory-table__definition">Often perceived as ‘assistant’, the kōken is in fact an important non-performing performer. The shite’s kōken is typically his senior and always from the same school. His active function is to oversee all stage activity, help with on stage changing of costume when necessary, prompting in a normal voice if the shite forgets a line and handling props as required. He also has the responsibility to take over should the shite be unable to complete the performance. Sitting in the back stage-right, the kōken provides the shite with an important anchoring presence on stage.</div>

    <h2>Taiko Patterns and Rhythmic Organization</h2>
    <p>At a basic level the sounds of the taiko are sequenced to create patterns. Most patterns are eight beats long and typically start on the 2nd or 6th beat of the 8-beat metric unit. However there are patterns as short as two and as long as 24 beats in duration. The patterns are sequenced into larger phrases and sections. They are selected and ordered according to various sets of rules based on their formal function. The sequencing can vary depending on a specific section. The following figure shows one example of standard categories of patterns used in dance and ô-nori chanting; and how they can be sequenced.</p>
