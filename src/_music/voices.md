Although the tsure can also dance, if only one is to dance it will always be the shite. The story revolves around him. At first, we usually know nothing if not very little about his true identity. Often, he is a character from another world, embodying for example a divine being or deceased person. In the latter case, (and considering that most plays are composed of two acts) the first act shite is often a spirit who has taken the form of a person, and the ghost or apparition of the same spirit in the second act.</td>

      <td class="content-table__column">It is in the early 17th century that the chorus called jiutai became a permanent stage member. Until that time, the shite and waki sung in unison the parts that constitute today's jiutai's part. The members of the group are not masked. Today's standard membership varies between 6 and 10 performers. The role of the jiutai is to keep the story going, setting the scene, describing the characters and actions.  It does not have an identity of its own, singing in unison only, it can either be a narrator or ‘speak’ for the shite or waki. Its first singing moment in a play called <em>shodō</em>, always marks an important point in the development of a play. The members of the jiutai are always from the same school as the shite. Besides the eight-member jiutai of both plays, our academic examples feature a two-person jiutai, </td>

      <td class="content-table__column">Often perceived as ‘assistant’, the kōken is in fact an important non-performing actor. The shite’s kōken is typically his senior and always from the same school. His active function is to oversee all stage activity, help with on stage changing of costume when necessary, prompting in a normal voice if the shite forgets a line and handling props as required. He also has the responsibility to take over should the shite be unable to complete the performance. Sitting in the back stage-right, the kōken provides the shite with an important anchoring presence on stage.</td>

We usually know who he is from the beginning since he typically introduces himself immediately after arriving on stage. He engages the shite and provides him with a reason to re-appear and perform. Plays without a waki are exceptionally few. The waki is always a realistic character. There are three majors types of waki character: a shrine official or retainer; a warrior; but most commonly a traveling priest. In some plays the waki has one or few unmasked companion actors called waki tsure.</td>

During the time he changes costume to transform into the nochi-shite (second act shite) an ai-kyōgen performs the interlude between two acts. Usually not masked and a realistic character, he often provides a summary of the first act and context for the second by engaging in a discussion with the waki if he has remained on stage.</td>

    <p>All vocal production in Noh is uniquely stylized and falls in two general categories: <a href="#spoken">spoken</a> and <a href="#chanted">chanted</a> </p>
    <h3 id="spoken"> Spoken</h3>
    <p>
    The spoken sections called <em>kotoba</em> consist of non-rhythmical prose intoned with a full voice. Usually, sentences are divided into two parts: a gradual rising tone reaching a peak followed by a falling off.  In the text transcription of the video excerpts the colored syllables are used to identify the higher pitches leading to the descent.
</p><p>
Sections in <em>kotoba</em> are always delivered by an actor, never by the jiutai. The difference in style between the shite's and waki's kotoba can be heard in the following examples: Hashitomi - Nanori, Kokaji - Nanori, and Kokaji - Mondō

        <p>
The chanted music called <em>utai</em> is sung in two different styles: <em>yowagin</em> – a gentler melodic singing and <em>tsuyogin</em> – a more forceful and dramatic one.

      <section id="yowagin" title="Yowagin" class="tabbed-narrative">
        <p>
        When singing in yowagin style, the actor uses a modest vibrato producing melodies with clearly perceptible stable pitches. This style is used for passages expressing elegance and pathos.
         </p><p>
        The ‘tonic’ of a chant in Nō is not absolute but determined by the performer, however the chant’s intervals are fixed. The entire range covers two octaves and it is divided up into four register zones: Very low, Low, Prime, and High, each one covering more or less the span of a perfect fourth.
         </p><p>
        Pitches being relative they are referred to by name rather than by pitch. The three most important pitches are the Low, Medium, and High (in our example B2, E3, and A3 respectively), and the majority of the chants are set around these three pole-pitches. Intermediate pitches are used to melodically flow from one of these pole-pitches to another.
        Finally, the lower and higher ranges are extended with the addition of the low ryo and the ryo (E2 and F#2 respectively) for the former, and the kuri and high kuri (C4 and E4 respectively) for that later.

        <p>While singing in tsuyogin style, the actor uses a notable vibrato with utterances usually contained within a small range span. This style is used for most dramatic passages such as those expressing excitement, bravery, or solemnity.

The actors are not attempting to produce specific melodic pitches. Their singing oscillates mainly within a minor third shown below as Low and Medium/High tones. However, at specific moments the Medium/High tone is embellished by higher tones.

        <h2 id="Rhythm"> Rhythm</h2>
        <p> The vocal parts fall into two main categories of rhythm: <a href="#Congruent">congruent</a>  when their parts align with specific beats, and <a href="#Noncongruent">non-congruent</a>  when they do not.</p>
        <h3 id="Congruent">Congruent (au)</h3>
        <p>A Noh chant is said to be congruent when its syllables coincide with the measure’s beats. There are three possible congruent settings: <a href="#Hiranori">hiranori</a>, <a href="#Onori">ōnori</a>, and <a href="#Chunori">chūnori</a>.
</p>
<h4 id="Hiranori">Hiranori</h4>
<p>Verse consisting of alternating lines of -seven and five- syllables is considered to be the most lyrical and elegant form of Japanese poetry as seen in haiku, waka, and renga, among others. Hiranori is the basic rhythmic form used in Nō where the poetic twelve syllables match with the honji’s eight-beat. Considering that there is a possibility of two syllables per beat for a total of sixteen syllables per honji, this leaves space for four caesuras. There is no standard position for the caesuras, but their distribution often divides the honji in two asymmetric parts: one of four beats and a half, the other one with three beats and a half. All examples are based on Hashitomi’s first ageuta.

</p><p>
The hiranori setting has two singing styles: <a href="#Tsuzukeutai">tsuzuke-utai</a> and <a href="#Mitsujiutai">mitsuji-utai</a>. The explanation is followed with a <a href="#Hiranoridemo">demonstration in context</a>demonstration in context.
</p>
<h5 id="Tsuzukeutai">h5-Tsuzuke-utai</h5>
<p>When singing in tsuzuke-utai, syllables are held over the first, third, and fifth beats, so that the twelve syllables fit within the honji (8-beat unit). In other words, the text is manipulated for the benefit of a steady metric structure, hence the eight beats of the unit are equidistant.
</p><p>
The example below shows an academic distribution of the twelve syllables in two groups of seven and five; with the group of seven syllables broken into: 1 + 3 + 3, with the first syllable starting on the upbeat preceding the very first beat. The figure also shows that the syllables preceding the first third and fifth beats are held over the downbbeat, as if to avoid competing with the ōtsuzumi’s strong strokes that usually fall on at least one of these downbeats. The fourth caesura occurs on the eighth downbeat in order to separate the two parts.
</p>
  {% include image.html src="/assets/images/Tsuzukeutai.jpg" %}
  <p>Here is a more dynamic distribution of the four caesuras, with a setting that follows the grammatical structure of the text. FOLLOWING JPG NEEDS REPLACING WITH A CORRECT ONE THAT NEEDS CORRECTING IN ITSELF </p>

  <p> Occasionally, lines of text do not fit within the 7 + 5 model. As a matter of fact, the number of syllables of the first part can vary between two and ten, and between three and eight for the second part.
There are two adjusting methods to accommodate such case: the first one involves shifting the beat of the text’s very first syllable, whereas the second method involves the insertion of measures of various sizes.
</p>
<h6>H6 First Method</h6>
<p>One method of fitting la larger than twelve syllables line of text within a honji (an eight-beat unit) consist of starting the first syllable of that line on a beat earlier that the standard upbeat to the very first beat. For example, the last line of text of Hashitomi’s first ageuta is comprised of thirteen syllables: 8 + 5.</p>
  {% include image.html src="/assets/images/Firstmethod.jpg" %}
  <p> In this case, ‘Ta’ the first syllable starts on the eighth downbeat as seen below instead of the usually upbeat to the very first beat:</p>
    {% include image.html src="/assets/images/Firstmethod2.jpg" %}
<h6>H6 second Method</h6>
    <p>Another method of fitting a larger than twelve syllables line of text within a honij (eight-beat unit) consists of introducing measures of two (okuriji), four (toriji), or six (kataji) beats. For example, here are the first three lines of Kokaji’s kiri. Its syllabic structure is: 7 + 5, 7 + 6, and 9 + 5.</p>
      {% include image.html src="/assets/images/Secondmethod.jpg" %}
      <p> A toriji (measure of four beats) has been inserted between the second and third honji (eight beat unit) in order to counter-balance the odd syllabic structure of the text. When it comes to measures other than the honji, the toriji is far more common that the two- and six-beat measures.</p>
