    <h2 id="Rhythm"> Vocal Rhythms</h2>

    <p> The vocal parts fall into two main categories of rhythm: congruent when their parts align with specific beats, and non-congruent when they do not.</p>

    <h3>Congruent (au)></h3>
    <p>A Noh chant is congruent when its syllables coincide with the measure’s beats. There are three possible congruent settings: <a href="#Hiranori">hiranori</a>, <a href="#Onori">ōnori</a>, and <a href="#Chunori">chūnori</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="Hiranori">Hiranori</h4>

    <p>Verse consisting of alternating lines of 7 + 5 syllables is the most lyrical and elegant form of Japanese poetry, evident in haiku, waka, and renga, among others. <em>Hiranori</em> is the basic rhythmic form used in Noh in which the poetic twelve syllables match with the <em>honji’s</em> eight-beat. Since there is a possibility of two syllables per beat for a total of sixteen syllables per <em>honji</em>, this leaves space for four caesuras. There is no standard position for these caesuras, but their distribution often divides the <em>honji</em> in two asymmetric parts: one of four and a half beats, the other one with three and a half beats. All examples are based on Hashitomi’s first <em>Aageuta</em>.</p>

    <p>The <em>hiranori</em> setting has two singing styles: <a href="#Tsuzukeutai">tsuzuke-utai</a> and <a href="#Mitsujiutai">mitsuji-utai</a>. The explanation of examples of the two individual styles is followed by a <a href="#Hiranoridemo">demonstration in the context</a> of a section where the two complement each other.</p>

    <h5 id="Tsuzukeutai">h5-Tsuzuke-utai</h5>

    <p>When singing in <em>tsuzuke-utai</em>, syllables are held over the first, third, and fifth beats, so that the twelve syllables fit within the <em>honji</em> (8-beat unit). In other words, the text is manipulated for the benefit of a steady metric structure, so the eight beats of the unit are spaced evenly.</</p>

    <p>The example below shows an academic distribution of the twelve syllables in two groups of seven and five; the group of seven syllables is broken into 1 + 3 + 3, with the first syllable starting on the upbeat preceding the very first beat. The figure also shows the syllables preceding the first third and fifth beats are held over the downbeat, which avoids competing with the ōtsuzumi’s strong strokes, usually falling on at least one of these downbeats. The fourth caesura occurs on the eighth downbeat in order to separate the two parts.</p>

    <p>Here is a more dynamic distribution of the four caesuras, with a setting that follows the grammatical structure of the text. FOLLOWING JPG NEEDS REPLACING WITH A CORRECT ONE THAT NEEDS CORRECTING IN ITSELF </p>

    <p> Occasionally, lines of text do not fit within the 7 + 5 model. In fact, the number of syllables of the first part can vary between two and ten, and between three and eight for the second part.</p>

    <p>There are two adjusting methods to accommodate such case: the first one involves shifting the beat of the text’s very first syllable, and the second method involves the insertion of measures of various sizes.</p>

    <p>One method of fitting a line of text longer than twelve syllables within a <em>honji</em> (an eight-beat unit) consists of starting the first syllable of that line on a beat earlier that the standard upbeat to the very first beat. For example, the last line of text of Hashitomi’s first <em>Ageuta</em> is comprised of thirteen syllables: 8 + 5.</p>

    {% include image.html
      src="/assets/images/Firstmethod.jpg"

    %}
    <p> In this case, ‘Ta’ the first syllable starts on the eighth downbeat, shown below, instead of the usual upbeat to the very first beat:</p>
    {% include image.html
      src="/assets/images/Firstmethod2.jpg"
    %}
    <p>Another method of fitting a line of text longer than twelve syllables within a <em>honji</em> (eight-beat unit) consists of introducing measures of two (<em>okuriji</em>), four (<em>toriji</em), or six (<em>kataji</em) beats. For example, in the first three lines of Kokaji’s <em>Kiri</em>, the syllabic structure is 7 + 5, 7 + 6, and 9 + 5.</p>

    {% include image.html
      src="/assets/images/Secondmethod.jpg"
    %}
    <p> A <em>toriji</em> (measure of four beats) has been inserted between the second and third <em>honji</em> (eight beat unit) to counter-balance the odd syllabic structure of the text. When it comes to other measures, the <em>toriji</em> is far more common that the two- and six-beat measures.</p>

    <h4 id="Mitsujiutai">h4-Mitsuji-utai</h4>

    <p>When singing in <em>mitsuji-utai</em>, syllables are rarely held over, hence the <em>honji</em> (8-beat unit) is condensed to fit the text. In other words, the metric structure is manipulated for the benefit of the text's declamation.  This means the eight beats of the unit are not evenly spaced.  Compared with <em>tsuzuke-utai</em>, a setting in <em>mitsuji-utai</em> is more dynamic since the melodic momentum is rarely interrupted by held-over tones.</p>

    <p>Here is the text from Hashitomi’s first <em>Aageuta</em> set in <em>mitsuji-utai</em>, where the condensed first, third, and fifth beats appear in boxes.</p>

    <h4 id="Hiranoridemo">h4-Demonstration in context</h4>

    <p>In the context of a chant, <em>mitsuji-utai</em> and <em>tsuzuke-utai</em> vary and control the rhythmic flow of the chant. The changes from <em>mitsuji-utai</em> to <em>tsuzuke-utai</em> are not left at the discretion of the performers though, rather the music is entirely written out, and typically includes back and forth transition between the two <em>utai</em>. The cycle '<em>mitsuji</em>- to <em>tsuzuke-utai</em>' always starts with <em>mitsuji-utai</em> leading to <em>tsuzuke-utai</em>, which either leads to a cadential pattern or to another <em>mitsuji-utai</em> to start another cycle.</p>

    <p>It is noteworthy that sparse <em>mitusji</em> patterns usually accompany the part of a chant set in the declamatory <em>mitsuji-utai</em>, where the limited number of percussion strokes is counter-balanced by the melodic line unfolding with little or no rests. On the other hand, the regular <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns usually accompany part of a chant set in the <em>tsuzuke-uta</em>i, where syllables held over to accommodate the measure’s eight beats create rest in the melodic line counter-balanced by the steady percussion strokes.</p>

    <p>Here is the text setting for the first <em>Ageuta</em> from Hashitomi. Since this chant is fairly short, it includes only one motion from <em>mitsuji-utai</em> to <em>tsuzuke-utai</em>, with the first three lines set in <em>mitsuji-utai</em> accompanied with sparse <em>mitsuji</em> patterns in the percussion, and the last three in <em>tsuzuke-utai</em> accompanied with steady <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns in the percussion.</p>

    <h4 id="Onori">Ōnori</h4>

    <p>The model text setting in <em>ônori</em> has one syllable per beat. The first syllable of each line of text usually comes on the second beat. Because of its periodic quality, this text setting is often used before or after a dance or in the concluding module (<em>shôdan</em>) of a play, the <em>Kiri</em>.</p>

    <h4 id="Chunori">Chūnori</h4>

    <p>Text set in <em>chūnori</em> has two syllables per beat. The first syllable of each line of text usually comes on the first beat, with a complete line finishing within the span of a single eight-beat unit (<em>honji</em>).</p>

    <p>Because of its lively quality, this text setting is often used for description of an active moment, such as a battle. Although, it is common practice for a module with text set to <em>chūnori</em> to also include passages set in <em>hiranori</em>, its eight beats are almost never contracted like in to <em>mitsuji-utai</em>, rather, they remain steady.</p>

    <h3 id="Non-congruent">Non-congruent (awazu)</h3>

    <p>The emphasis for non-congruent chants is on the text and melodic line. With this text setting there is no coordination between syllables and the unit’s eight beats. There are two types of non-congruent chant: <em>sashinori</em> and <em>einori</em>.</p>

    <h4 id="Sashinori">Sashinori</h4>

    <p>><em>Sashinori</em> chant is always accompanied by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi in a flexible setting, while <em>einori</em> chant can be accompanied by the hand percussion instruments in either strict or flexible setting. If the chant includes a nohkan part it will also be non-congruent.</p>

    <p>><em>Sashinori</em> chants are sung in a recitative style. They are usually accompanied by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi in a flexible setting, favoring the sparse <em>mitsuji</em> patterns. There is a Japanese expression that describes the idea behind a non-congruent chant accompanied by non-congruent percussion: <em>fusoku furi</em>, which means ‘not separate but not together’. There are exceptions though, for instance the <em>Kuri</em>, also accompanied by the two hand-drums but in strict setting, favors the <em>tsuzuke</em> pattern.</p>

    <p>The <em>Sashi</em> from Kokaji, sung in <em>tsuyogin</em> mode, is composed of two phrases. Each one begins by a solo performed the shite followed by a reply by the jiutai. The phrases are broken up into segments rhythmically characterized by a pulse that is slightly accelerated before coming to a longer duration. The notes with longer duration are all positioned on words that reinforce the text's phrase structure or its meaning. For the most part, each segment stays on the high pitch, which is usually preceded with an inflection from below. Finally, the chant concludes on the low tone.</p>

    <p>The provided score for this excerpt shows the first phrase composed of six segments, each one concluded by a sustained-tone: the first one presented by the shite, and the next six by the jiutai, identified in the score with the numbers 1 to 6. It is the two percussionists' responsibility to position their four <em>mitsuji</em> patterns against these seven segments.</p>

    <h4 id="Einori">Einori</h4>

    <p>><em>Einori</em> chants are usually accompanied by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi in strict setting. The <em>Issei</em>-chant from Hashitomi is sung in <em>yowagin</em> style, and focuses on only four pitches: the Medium and High, and their respective Intermediate pitch a tone lower. It is divided up into two segments, the first one sang by the shite, the second one by the jiutai.</p>

    <p>The hand-percussion instruments start both segments with sparse <em>mitsuij</em> patterns before moving on with <em>tzusuke</em> patterns.   While performing the sparse <em>mitsuji</em> patterns, the ōtsuzumi player has some flexibility to adapt to the melodic line. This is particularly clear with this recording. When performing the first <em>mitsuji</em> patterns, the ōtsuzumi player uses extended <em>kakegoe</em> reminiscent of the flexible rhythmic setting, whereas the kotsuzumi player uses throughout the chant, short <em>kakegoe</em> redolent of the strict setting.</p>
