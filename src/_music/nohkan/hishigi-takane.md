    <h2><em>Hishigi takane mi kusari</em></h2>
    <p><em>Hishigi takane mi kusari</em> is composed of three phrases. Its shoga is:
<em>o-hya ra<br>
o-hya hi-u hyū i<br>
hi-hyo ru ri
</em>
</p><p> The shoga for the shrilling <em>hishigi</em> sound is <em>‘hi’</em>, also used for a standard sound heard in various patterns. In this pattern the <em>‘hi’</em> standing for the <em>hishigi</em> appears in the second line, while the standard one is heard at the beginning of the third line. To differentiate them in the video,  we used the kanji 日(hi) to represent the <em>hishigi</em> sound.  </p>
