    <h2><em>Takane mi kusari</em></h2>
    <p><em>Takane mi kusari</em> is composed of three phrases. Its shoga is:
<em>o-hya ra<br>
o-hya ro-i<br>
hi-hyo ru ri
</em>
</p><p>The following examples illustrate the difference in expressive inflection given to basic patterns when heard in contrasting contexts. The <em>Takane mi kusari</em> pattern is first heard in its ‘generic’ form, and then as performed in Kokaji’s <em>Kuse</em> involving a male deity, and in Hashitomi’s <em>Kuse</em> which showcase a young maiden. The stronger attack and faster speed of the former, well fitting in the context of a virile divine being, are contrasted in the latter with a softer attack and slower speed to better reflect the character of a lady.</p>
