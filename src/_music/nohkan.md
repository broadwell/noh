    <h2>Nohkan</h2>
    <p>In presenting this partial catalog our objective was to record the principal nohkan patterns that can be heard in one or both of the plays featured in this website: Kokaji and Hashitomi.</p>

    <p>One of the nohkan's roles is to create an ambiance that reflects the particular emotions of the play, the status or psychological mindset of a character. This is achieved by inflecting given basic patterns with appropriate expressive characteristics. In the hope to provide the user with a reference to better appreciate such transformation we asked MORITA Yasuyoshi to perform ‘generic' version of the patterns that could then be compared with their use withing the plays. He was at first rather uneasy about this, since strictly speaking there are no ‘generic’ versions. Patterns are always learned and performed in the context of a specific play, with a particular character in mind. We appreciate the exception he made for this educational purpose. Within the catalog, two patterns: Naka no takane and Takane mi kusari are first heard in their 'generic' form and then played as performed in Kokaji Kuse involving a manly God, compared with Hashitomi Kuse which involves a young maiden.</p>

    <p>For nohkan players, the learning and teaching of patterns is done through mnemonic songs called shōga. For example, the shōga for the pattern takane is: "o-hya ra", where each syllable represents a sound often composed of a sequence of pitches rather than a single one. Moreover, a shōga does not carry any information on its duration, since it changes depending on context.</p>

    <p>Finally, a word about the hishigi is required since this is an unusual tone. The hishigi is a shrill, high-pitched tone that is not used in any melodies. Rather, it comes about as a powerful and striking effect sometimes described as an invocation to gods. It often marks the end of a play, or the beginning or end of a section.</p>

    <p>Besides helping set the proper mood of a section, the nohkan's patterns are also used to articulate the structure of a section. For instance, three melodic patterns are usually performed during an Ageuta (a sung section): takane, naka no takane, and mi roku no ge. They stand out because they each appear once as short utterances, played at their own specific point in the section.</p>

    <p>First, the sequence of the patterns accentuates the melodic shape of the chant which starts in the higher range, moves to the middle  and closes in the low range. This descent is imitated by the nohkan's sequence of patterns, which start with takane followed by naka no takane, both in the instrument's higher range followed by the mi roku no ge whose melodic contour moves from the medium to the low range.</p>

    <p>Second, the positioning of the patterns also underlines the structure of the text, which is characterized by a repeated first and last line. The reiteration of the first line is preceded by the nohkan's takane pattern, while the first statement of the last line of text is underlined by the entrance of the mi roku no ge pattern. The naka no takane does not have a specific position, but it is usually played at the point where the vocal line is about to move from the higher to the medium range.</p>

    <p>There are exceptions to this basic structure, for instance,  the naka no takane is left out from the  first ageuta from Hashitomi, which is short. Its second ageuta being even shorter, only includes the first nohkan pattern: takane.</p>

    <p>Here is the text from the first ageuta from Hashitomi and the position of the two nohkan's patterns:</p>
