    <h2 id="Nohkan">Nohkan (Flute)</h2>
    <p> There are three nohkan schools: Morita, Issō, Fujita. Featured MORITA Yasuyoshi and all examples are from the Morita tradition.</p>
    <h3 id="Sound">Sound of the nohkan</h3>
<p>
The scale of this seven-hole instrument, member of the traverse flute family, is rather unusual because of a thin bamboo tube called nodo, inserted between its mouth hole and first finger hole. The nodo distorts natural acoustical behavior of the pipe and as a result its scale consists of microtonal pitches that do not fit any predictable mode. Moreover, the pitches vary from instrument to instrument. It is also believed that it helps produce hishigi the highest pitch on the instrument and an important pattern.</p><p>

The following figure shows the approximate principle pitches produced by one particular nohkan (half-hole pitches were not recorded).  The row of pitches on the second system are the continuation of the first and are produced with an increased airflow using the exact same fingerings as the first. In the case of most world flutes as well as other Japanese traverse flutes like the ryûteki, komabue, and kagurabue, such overblowing would consistently produce pitches an octave higher and as a result extend the same scale. In the case of nohkan, the overblowing of the lowest note results in a pitch a minor tenth higher and with every following note that interval diminishes gradually so that the interval resulting out of the overblowing of the highest note is a major sixth, hence the increased air pressure process adds a new set of pitches to the overall scale.</p>

<p>Whereas Western flutists use the distal phalanges to cover the instrument's key and holes, the nohkan players use their intermediate phalanges allowing for very subtle half-holing that produces additional microtonal fluctuations in the pitch.</p><p>

The microtonal and unregulated pitch material of the nohkan is meant to function independently from the singers. The chant's central pitch is set by the primary actor during the performance, independently from the nohkan's pitches. The overall compatibility of energy and sometimes pitch is part of a natural process happening in response to the circumstances and spirit of a particular performance.  This freedom between the pitch material of the actors and the nohkan is also facilitated by their separation in range, the nohkan being much higher than the sung chant.</p><p>

The mode of attack is another important factor that adds to the richness of nohkan's sound palette. To enunciate new notes the nohkan players use increased air pressure controlled by the diaphragm. This allows for a differing sharpness of attacks from sudden to slurred. Tonguing, a common performance practice of the West involving making a silent use of syllables like "ta" or "da" to break the flow of air is not used.</p>

<h3 id="Patterns">Catalog of Patterns</h3>
    <p>In presenting this partial catalog our objective was to record the principal nohkan patterns that can be heard in one or both of the plays featured in this website: Kokaji and Hashitomi.</p>

    <p>One of the nohkan's roles is to create an ambiance that reflects the particular emotions of the play, the status or psychological mindset of a character. This is achieved by inflecting given basic patterns with appropriate expressive characteristics. In the hope to provide the user with a reference to better appreciate such transformation we asked MORITA Yasuyoshi to perform ‘generic' version of the patterns that could then be compared with their use withing the plays. He was at first rather uneasy about this, since strictly speaking there are no ‘generic’ versions. Patterns are always learned and performed in the context of a specific play, with a particular character in mind. We appreciate the exception he made for this educational purpose. Within the catalog, two patterns: Naka no takane and Takane mi kusari are first heard in their 'generic' form and then played as performed in Kokaji Kuse involving a manly God, compared with Hashitomi Kuse which involves a young maiden.</p>

    <p>For nohkan players, the learning and teaching of patterns is done through mnemonic songs called shōga. For example, the shōga for the pattern takane is: "o-hya ra", where each syllable represents a sound often composed of a sequence of pitches rather than a single one. Moreover, a shōga does not carry any information on its duration, since it changes depending on context.</p>

    <p>Finally, a word about the hishigi is required since this is an unusual tone. The hishigi is a shrill, high-pitched tone that is not used in any melodies. Rather, it comes about as a powerful and striking effect sometimes described as an invocation to gods. It often marks the end of a play, or the beginning or end of a section.</p>

    <p>Besides helping set the proper mood of a section, the nohkan's patterns are also used to articulate the structure of a section. For instance, three melodic patterns are usually performed during an Ageuta (a sung section): takane, naka no takane, and mi roku no ge. They stand out because they each appear once as short utterances, played at their own specific point in the section.</p>

    <p>First, the sequence of the patterns accentuates the melodic shape of the chant which starts in the higher range, moves to the middle  and closes in the low range. This descent is imitated by the nohkan's sequence of patterns, which start with takane followed by naka no takane, both in the instrument's higher range followed by the mi roku no ge whose melodic contour moves from the medium to the low range.</p>

    <p>Second, the positioning of the patterns also underlines the structure of the text, which is characterized by a repeated first and last line. The reiteration of the first line is preceded by the nohkan's takane pattern, while the first statement of the last line of text is underlined by the entrance of the mi roku no ge pattern. The naka no takane does not have a specific position, but it is usually played at the point where the vocal line is about to move from the higher to the medium range.</p>

    <p>There are exceptions to this basic structure, for instance,  the naka no takane is left out from the  first ageuta from Hashitomi, which is short. Its second ageuta being even shorter, only includes the first nohkan pattern: takane.</p>

    <p>Here is the text from the first ageuta from Hashitomi and the position of the two nohkan's patterns:</p>
